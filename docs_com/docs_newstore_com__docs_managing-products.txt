Products are a central entity in the NewStore platform. Most of the business flows depend on it.
For a product to appear in the platform or in the apps, it needs at least:
Some product information in the catalog
A price for the specific
shop
and
locale
Identifying products
The attribute
product_id
is the universal identifier of a product inside a
shop
and
locale
in NewStore. It is the only identifier that is used in all API calls to identify the product in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud.
If you have other identifiers for your products, such as SKU or EAN in your business, import them in the
external_identifiers
property. They must be unique to properly identify product ID.
You can query and scan a product by using its exact
product_id
or any identifier defined in
external_identifiers
. If you want to be able to search for a specific external identifier,
see here
.
Important
We do not recommend using special characters when specifying a value for the
product_id
or
external_identifiers
property. However, NewStore supports special characters (reserved, unreserved, and escaped characters) based on the
RFC guidelines
, except
=
(the equal symbol) and
%
(the percentage symbol). For more information, see Section 2.1 in the RFC guidelines.
Master locale
The
master locale
is a way to define default field values (e.g. SKUs or extended attributes) that other locales in the same catalog inherit when you import them. In every catalog there can be only one master locale.
To set a locale as master locale in a catalog, set the
is_master
property in the import file's header to
true
. This will set all the products in that import file as
master products
. That means that if you import the same product to another locale, and it does not have all the properties filled in, the import will fill in the missing properties with those of the master product.
For example, let's take three imports with the following locales and master settings:
catalog
:
storefront-en
,
locale
:
en-us
,
product_id
:
product1
,
is_master
:
true
catalog
:
storefront-en
,
locale
:
en-uk
,
product_id
:
product1
,
is_master
:
false
catalog
:
storefront-en
,
locale
:
en-au
,
product_id
:
product1
,
is_master
:
false
In this case, data of
product1
will be copied from the master locale
en-us
to non-master locales
en-uk
and
en-au
.
Important
After importing the master locale for the first time, in every consecutive imports to the same locale you have to set the
is_master
property to
true
. If you set the
is_master
property in the header to
false
, the import marks the products in that specific import as non-master products within your master locale, and hence their data won't be copied to other locales.
If you do an import to the master locale with changes in the products, those changes won't be automatically propagated to non-master locales. To update products in non-master locales, reimport the products to the non-master locale.
To change the master locale of a catalog, do an import with the new master locale in the header and set the
is_master
property to
true
.
Important
If the
is_master
property is not specified in the head of an import file, NewStore considers the import to be a master locale, and consecutive imports to other locales will copy product data from this import.
However, if you set the
is_master
property to
false
in
every
import, then there is no master locale and no data will be inherited during imports.
Controlling visibility of products in NewStore
For a product to appear in Omnichannel Manager, in Associate App, and in Shopping App, set the attribute
show_in_listing
of the product to
true
. When this is set to
false
for a product, the only way to retrieve this product is via the
Get product details method
in the Customer API.
To control season-specific products, set the attributes
online_from
and
online_to
to the appropriate date. Leave this empty if the product is always available to be sold and is not limited to specific dates. To indicate when the product is available to be sold for a specific period, provide either the start date, the end date or both. This also determines if the product is returned in Associate App depending on the current date. Keep this in mind when you test your import. To see how to use these attributes in combination with pre-orders,
see here
.
Searching and filtering
By default products can be searched by title, description, color, size, and caption.
To enable search and filtering in additional fields, use the
head
section of your product import.
You can
enable filtering
using the
filterable_attributes
property. It uses
JSONPath
.
You can
enable searching
using the
searchable_attributes
property. It uses
JSONPath
. You can set the
weight
property to specify the importance of each attribute compared to other searchable attributes.
To validate JSONPath, use a
JSONPath validator
.
Important
If you change (add/delete) searchable or filterable attributes in the head of your product import, ensure to reimport all products with the changed head. Otherwise, the changes are only applied to the products imported along with the changed head attributes.
Tutorial to configure filter and search attributes
Follow the
product import tutorial
, but use this payload as
products.json
instead.

            ]
        }
    ]
}
Follow the rest of the tutorial as explained. After this import is done, the products included in the import will be searchable and filterable by the newly configured attributes.
Product images
A product can have multiple images. To define a main image, set the attribute
is_main
of the image to
true
.
By default, NewStore downloads all the images that are imported and uses its own image processing service to make them available in different sizes and formats for consumption in the apps.
To use your own image hosting service, set the property
internal_disable_image_processing
to
true
in the
head
element of your product import. Make sure your image hosting service can handle the expected amount of requests. In this case, you also need to specify
internal_dimension_height
,
internal_dimension_width
and
internal_dominant_color
for each image you provide.
Use case: Pre-orders
To enable pre-orders for a product, ensure that you specify a date for the
online_from
property. NewStore starts fulfilling pre-ordered products from the date you provide in the
online_from
property.
NewStore checks periodically every 2 hours if there are pre-order products for which the
online_from
date has been reached, and makes them available for routing.
If your product can be pre-ordered, specify a date in the
preorder_start
attribute to indicate from when the product will be available for pre-orders. Specify an earlier date than the date you have specified in the
online_from
property.
Both these attributes are needed for pre-orders to be enabled for the product.
See
here the more thorough guide about pre-orders
.
General product-related FAQs
Why isn’t my product(s) showing up in Omnichannel Manager or in Associate App?
Some of the possible reasons of your product not showing up in the catalog are:
The product is missing in the catalog.
The product didn't have a default price specified during the import process.
How do I delete products or categories from the catalog?
We do not support a direct way to delete a certain product because we want to ensure the continuity of business flows, such as a customer returning a product that is no longer sold, as well as data integrity - keeping product information of all existing orders.
The easiest and safest way to hide a product is to set its
online_to
property to a past date. This way, the product will not be shown while browsing the Associate App, but other functionalities such as
returns
If you need to delete all products, such as when a mistake is made when setting up the tenant in a sandbox or staging environment, use the
full import
functionality.
To delete all products and categories from the catalog, perform a
full import
. This is an action with high impact and consequences, we recommend
not
using this method for tenants running in production.
Important
Be aware that a full import
deletes ALL
of the currently stored data. Only the data freshly imported via the new import job is retained, and this may affect other operations or functionalities in the platform.
We
do not
recommend using full imports in your production environment.
Performing a full import with multiple catalog/locale combinations in the same zip file can lead to unexpected behavior, and can result in complete loss of data of the affected entities. If you only want to hide specific products or categories, the easiest way is to set their
online_to
property to a past date.
When you delete or deprecate a product,
ensure that you remove (change to 0) ALL inventory for the specific product.
Failing to do so may leave remnants of inventory data in the system, which may cause inaccuracies in stock data and cycle counts.
See
Importing data
for more details on performing a full import.
