Jun 2025
External identifier EPC emitted during purchases in the app or returns
Release Date: Jun 30, 2025
NewStore now emits the external identifier EPC (Electronic Product Code) when:
In-store purchase orders are created by scanning the QR code on RFID product tags (that include the EPC). This EPC value appears in the
order.created
event. See the
Event Stream Configuration API
.
Products that were sold or fulfilled by scanning the QR code on RFID product tags (that include the EPC), and are returned. This EPC value appears in the
return.processed
event. See the
Event Stream Configuration API
.
Default order ID is used if external order identifier sequence is not configured
Release Date: Jun 5, 2025
When setting up NewStore, if the order sequence for the external order Identifier is not set, a default ID using UUID v7 will be assigned. Once the sequence is configured, orders will stop using this default ID. See
Basic platform configuration
.
External identifier epc emitted when orders fulfilled
Release Date: Jun 4, 2025
When orders are fulfilled by scanning the QR code on RFID product tags (that include the Electronic Product Code (EPC)), the system now emits the external identifier
epc
. The value appears in the
order.serial_numbers_added
event when the order is handed over to the carrier or customer. See
Event Stream Configuration API
.
May 2025
New event in Event Stream for customer profile updates
Release Date:
May 12, 2025
A new event
order.customer_profile_amended
is now part of the NewStore Event Stream. This event ensures that third-party systems receive real-time updates when the customer profile linked to an order is modified. It is triggered when an orderâ€™s customer profile is updated and GraphQL queries will now return the
latest
customer profile instead of the one that was added to the order during order placement.
Any existing Event Stream integration that subscribes to all events will automatically receive this event starting
May
12,
2025
.
To enable this event via Omnichannel Manager, go to the
Event Stream
>
Orders
>
customer_profile_amended
, or use the
Event Stream Configuration API
.
April 2025
Receipt Updates for Spain
Release Date: April 22, 2025
NewStore now supports enhanced receipt generation capabilities for retailers operating in Spain, allowing the issuance of both Factura Simplificada (Simplified Invoice) and Factura Completa (Complete Invoice). This enhancement aids retailers in their compliance with Spanish fiscal regulations and provides greater flexibility in receipt management. Retailers already operating stores in Spain must complete the required fiscal activation for each store through the NewStore Omnichannel Manager. Refer to our
documentation
for detailed instructions on enabling and configuring this feature.
February 2025
Increased event replays to 60 days
Release Date: Feb 10, 2025
Events generated in the NewStore platform within the last 60 days can now be replayed freely. This extends the time window for resolving synchronization issues. By allowing at least 60 days to replay events, this should provide enough time to discover, understand, and then replay missing events before the window of replayability is closed.
January 2025
Worldline Payments Support
Release date: Jan 27, 2025
NewStore now supports Worldline as a POS payment provider in Europe. This integration enhances the NewStore POS system by enabling seamless cash-and-carry payment transactions, providing a reliable and efficient solution for in-store purchases. This integration leverages the Worldline payment gateway which enables support for multiple payment acquirer platforms in Europe. See the docs for configuration guidance.
Requires Associate App v1.59.0 or higher.
Full count and selling strategy
Release date: Jan 21, 2025
NewStore advises against selling when performing a full count. However, if a retailer chooses to continue selling during the count, the newly introduced
Full Count Strategy
configuration ensures that the platform will compare the counted quantities with either the initial expected stock on hand or the updated expected stock on hand quantities, depending on when the store is open to shoppers. See the docs on
configuration
.
October 2024
Cash rounding now applied to cash refunds
Release date: Oct 07, 2024
Cash refunds in regions where cash rounding is enabled will now follow the same rounding logic that has been implemented for the sales flow.

Associate App versions.
July 2024
Tax exemptions available in Italy
Release date
: July 31, 2024
Italian laws require that tax exemption codes for each exempt item be declared at checkout and printed on the receipt by fiscal printers. Retailers in Italy can now apply tax exemptions, offering tax relief to specific groups, such as diplomats or in special economic zones, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and ensuring tax compliance.
Retailers can configure the tax exemption categories and codes to comply with these regulations and update them when they are revised by the tax authorities. For more information see
Tax exemptions in Italy
.
Revamped customer profile screens
Feature release reminder
This is a
reminder
to enable the new customer profile screens in Associate App. We revamped and enhanced the customer profile screens in Associate App earlier, part of a redesign process to make it easier for associates to find, create, and assign customers to a profile.
Enhancements include:
Direct Access
: Access customer profiles from the cart, or when creating a customer that already exists.
Streamlined Creation
: Auto-populate fields when creating new profiles from the Search screen.
Simplified Address Management
: Create, update, or delete customer addresses quickly.
Enhanced Scanning Capability
: The app scanner can identify customer information from scanned codes.
Quick Assignment
: Assign customers to a cart directly from the search results.
Phone Number Validation
: Ensure accurate phone number formats (E.164).
Flexible Naming Formats
: Support both first and last name fields, as well as a single full name field.
Customization Opportunities
: Customize customer profiles to fit your specific needs, such as
Field Creation
: Create fields like customer notes, birthday dates, and loyalty ID for clienteling.
Webviews Integration
: Leverage webviews for greater flexibility and individual needs, such as displaying additional customer details or integrating with your eCommerce platform or CRM systems.
Important
All future enhancements and new features will be developed
exclusively
for the new screens. To enable the new customer profile screens, see
Enabling new customer profile screens
.
Enhanced features in Customer API v2
Enhanced support for customer name fields
If needed, retailers can keep using the
first_name
and
last_name
fields instead of switching to the
full_name
field when migrating to
Customer API v2
.
See the
migration guide
for more details.
Enhanced phone number validation
Feature release reminder
Customer API v2 now includes an enhanced phone number validation feature. This validation ensures the accuracy, reach, and quality of customer data by conforming to the E.164 standard, which requires a
+
sign followed by the country code and the national number.
See
Phone numbers

This will also affect imported orders where phone numbers for new customers are automatically converted to the E.164 format with 99.93% accuracy. The remaining invalid entries are saved in an extended attribute of the customer profile. See
Customer profile

Enhanced Offline Mode support in fiscal countries
Release date: July 10, 2024

For more information, see
Integrating a third-party promotion engine
.
Single Sign-On self-service
NewStore has now enabled retailers to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for access and management of NewStore apps and authentication through your preferred identity provider via self-service.
Note
NewStore currently supports these identity providers: Google, Okta or Microsoft.

Sales metrics in Associate App
Note
This is an
Early Access
version of the
Sales Dashboard
feature so expect some enhancements in the upcoming releases.
Retailers can
only
enable the
Sales Dashboard
globally across all the stores in their business, and not for individual stores.
Associates in the store can now view detailed metrics on sales and business performance in the
Sales Dashboard
within Associate App. The dashboard automatically displays data for the current day based on the store's local timezone. The dashboard also allows associates and store managers to view the sales performance of their store.

Staging
environment for testing and training purposes. To view the sales dashboard, in Associate App, tap
Selling

Avalara AvaTax
API v2 connector.

.
These gift card cashout transactions are also displayed in Omnichannel Manager in payment transaction reports. See
Monitoring cash transactions
.
Capacity-based routing
Retailers can now specify capacity-based routing limits for orders to be fulfilled by stores, allowing stores to not be overwhelmed with orders and missing delivery expectations. For example, you can decide to route orders for fulfillment to stores only during the open hours of business, such as from 8 am till 6 pm.
This feature allows retailers to control how much time associates spend fulfilling orders in the store, and monitor fulfillment operations across stores in their business. For more information, see
Managing capacity-based routing for stores
