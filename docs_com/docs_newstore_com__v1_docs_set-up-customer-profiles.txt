How can you set up customer profiles in NewStore?
There are multiple ways you can set up customer profiles, both when importing orders into the NewStore platform, as well as in bulk via APIs.
Importing customer profiles with order data
Customer data, including profile information, can be automatically imported into the platform when orders are imported. This feature allows associates to use Associate App to create or update customer profiles based on order details. See the
guide for importing orders
.
Automatic population of customer profile fields
Fields within customer profiles are automatically populated based on specified input, including extended attributes. This reduces the need for manual updates by associates. This feature can be configured in the Associate App settings to meet specific business needs. See
the guide on setting this up
.
Using APIs
Use the new
Customer Profile v2 APIs
to manage customer profiles.
Use cases and examples for leveraging customer profiles
You can use the data analysis and reporting from NewStore in a varied range of situations, where data driven decisions will help you optimize business performance. Some use cases have been described briefly below, which can be investigated in detail in the relevant sections.
Creating profiles for new customers
When a new customer makes a purchase, this information can be used to automatically generate a new profile, storing relevant details for future visits. This gives associates a head start in building a personalized connection and a tailored experience for the customer, right from the first interaction.
Maintaining accurate purchase history
Each time a customer makes a purchase, the app updates their profile to include recent transactions. For example, if a customer buys a particular product type frequently, associates can use this information to suggest similar products during clienteling conversations.
