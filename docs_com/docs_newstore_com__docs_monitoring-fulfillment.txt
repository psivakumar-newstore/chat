Viewing count details

You can also use the exported mispick or mispack data from NewStore Omnichannel Manager to analyze and monitor for patterns, or for investigations into counted products and variances in the stores.
To export mispick data:
Go to
Store Operations
>
Inventory
>
Mispicks
.
Click
Export All
.
The count data is exported into a CSV file.
Viewing exceptions on the inventory dashboard
On the inventory dashboard page, you can view exceptions that were identified while fulfilling orders, or transferring, adjusting, and counting inventory for your store.
When associates mispick a product in the store, the order is routed to another store for fulfillment. However, during cycle count, if these products are found to be available in the store's
stock on hand
, the number of such products is displayed on the dashboard.
Retailers can use these metrics to align store fulfillment expectations for their business.
To view exceptions on the inventory dashboard:
Go to
Store Operations
>
Inventory
>
Dashboard
.
From the drop-down menu, select a store to view exceptions found there in the last 30 days.
