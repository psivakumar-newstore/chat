Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the View orders permission.
The
Orders
page displays all orders that have been placed. Each order displays an order ID and all the order details for the orders across the different columns.
The
Status
column displays status of the order in the workflow and if it needs attention. To search for an order or a customer, use the search box.
Type a partial order ID, a customer name, or a combination of both. For example: enter
1231 Carrier
to display all order IDs containing
1231
from customers with
carrier
in their first or last name. To find all the orders to which a coupon has been applied, search by the coupon code.
Note
When searching for orders, ensure that you enter the complete order ID if your search string exceeds 8 characters. If you use a partial order ID to search for the order, it will only work if the length of search string is less than or equal to 8 characters.
For example, to find an order with ID
GD000447079
, a search with
0447079
works, as it is less than 8 characters, but searching with
000447079
will not work.
To filter the products in the search results by a column, click the column header. Every header you click is added to the current filter as filter criterion.
Filtering split orders
To filter and display
split orders
:
Select one or several locations from which the orders might have been fulfilled.
Sort the column alphabetically.
Look for orders showing
Multiple
in the
Location ID
column.
Note
There is no filter for
Multiple
.
