If products in your business contain extended attributes, they are not displayed in NewStore Associate App by default, even though they are imported into the platform during a
product import
. Enable this feature to display extended attributes of products on the
Product Details
screen in NewStore Associate App.
Extended product attributes can provide associates with extra information, such as the material an item is made out of.
Important
These extended attributes are added to the product before they are imported into the platform.
Do not
confuse them with
extended attributes for an order or order item
added by associates using the app.
To enable this feature for your business:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
customizations
>
displayed_extended_attributes
>
product_detail
, specify an array of the extended attributes to be displayed.
For each individual attribute, you can configure:
A unique name
A label for the attribute, with translated versions for certain locales.
The
label
property must have an
en
translation. Other optional locales that NewStore supports are:
de
es
fr
it
ja
ko
zh
Example configuration
See this example of an extended attribute configuration for a product in your business:
{
   "attribute_name": "material",
   "label": {
      "en": "Material",
      "de": "Stoff"
   }
}
Once enabled, the
Product Details
screen in NewStore Associate App displays a table with up to 4 extended attributes. To view the remaining extended attributes, tap
Show more details
. For more information on using NewStore Associate App, see this
guide
.
Note
The
Show more details
button is only displayed when the table has more than 4 rows.
