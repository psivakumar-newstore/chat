Setting up mobile Point of Sale (mPOS) with the NewStore Associate App enables associates' mobile devices to function as flexible POS systems. Store associates can handle transactions and manage store activities from anywhere in the store using Associate App. It helps improve the customer experience by eliminating fixed checkout stations and reduces long queues.The setup involves configuring hardware, enabling business-relevant features, and integrating with backend systems such as inventory, payments, and order management for seamless operations.
With NewStore Associate App, store associates can process transactions on mobile devices, including scanning items, applying discounts, completing payments, and issuing receipts. The app also supports advanced features such as customer profile lookups, loyalty program integration, and also supports personalized shopping experience for customers.
Overview of the setup process
Setting up mPOS for your business involves setting up the following:
Stores and warehouses
The first step in using NewStore as your omnichannel services and mPOS platform is to set up stores and warehouses in the platform. This allows you to configure physical locations to manage inventory, and optimize your order fulfillment processes. For more information, see
Setting up a store
.
Payments
NewStore offers a flexible, secure payment solution that integrates seamlessly into your retail ecosystem. NewStore supports multiple payment methods through integration with various payment service providers (PSPs). In-store associates can use
NewStore Checkout
for phone payments and NewStore SDK for processing with PSPs like Adyen. External payment options not integrated with these PSPs are also supported but require separate reconciliation. For more information, see
Setting up payments
.
Taxes
To ensure accurate tax calculation and compliance with tax laws, accurately setting up taxes is one of the crucial steps for businesses. NewStore Omnichannel Cloud facilitates automatic tax calculation for each order, leveraging third-party providers such as Avalara AvaTax and Vertex, or a custom tax provider that allows you to integrate your own tax provider or another third-party provider. Additionally, NewStore allows you to configure a default fixed tax rate to process transactions when network connectivity is unavailable. For more information, see
Setting up taxes
.
Promotions
NewStore Omnichannel Cloud offers a comprehensive promotions feature that allows retailers to create, manage, and apply various promotional campaigns seamlessly. Retailers can design custom discounts, special offers, and loyalty programs to enhance customer engagement and drive sales.
Retailers can also use a third-party promotion engine such as
Talon.One
, if the native promotion engine at NewStore does not cater to all your promotion and discount related requirements. For more information, see
Setting up promotions
.
Inventory management
NewStore Omnichannel Cloud allows you to manage inventory operations and stock locations using Associate App. You can enable a store in your business to use NewStore as inventory master, instead of an ERP, to manage inventory-related operations and data.
If you use NewStore as inventory master for a store, these inventory operations rely on stock locations that help you manage salable and unsalable stock. For more information, see
Setting up inventory management.
Reporting
The reporting feature in NewStore's platform is designed to enhance visibility and efficiency across various aspects of retail operations. You can see real-time updates about your inventory data across all locations, facilitate efficient transfer of inventory between locations, get advanced reports with our omnichannel manager, and more. For more information, see
Managing omnichannel insights
.
Administrate the app
Manage users and assign role-based access and permissions to associates for appropriate access within the app. Set up hardware devices like Bluetooth scanners and printers for seamless transactions, accurate scanning, and efficient receipt printing. Configure the app to meet your business requirements and distribute it to store associates using the Access and Brand Management (ABM) setup for streamlined deployment across your organization. For more information, see
Distributing Associate App
.
