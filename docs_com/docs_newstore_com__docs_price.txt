Pricing in NewStore is managed by grouping products and their associated prices into an entity called a
pricebook
.
When a product is created, it must be added to the default pricebook named "
default
". If the product is not included in this pricebook, the platform will not recognize or index it.
In addition to the default pricebook, a product can be added to other pricebooks for the same or different currency. The names of these additional pricebooks do not need to follow any specific convention.
Note
The membership price book is an exception to the standard price book naming convention. Refer to
Using a membership pricebook
for more details on the same.
NewStore supports multiple pricebooks and catalogs for a single currency. However,
only one pricebook and one catalog can be associated with a store at a time
.
