(daily close transaction).
Time
: The timestamp for when the transaction was processed, based on the timezone that the store operates in.

+ currency
amount, which is the cash used as the daily float for the drawer.

Transfer out
: Remove some money from the drawer to add it to another drawer in the store.

Provide loose change to a shopper who didn't purchase anything.
