Studio is the Content Management System (CMS) that NewStore designed to ensure your brand can take full advantage of your Shopping App. Our CMS offers you all the tools needed to create stunning mobile retail experiences. Easy-to-use, time-saving, and fun to work with.
Studio simplifies creating delightful, high-definition visual content to engage with your users:
Crafting beautiful home walls that amplify your campaigns, or high-converting Lookbooks (Video and Image) and brand stories that enhance your branding is easy with Studio.
With media editing, localization, and scheduling capabilities, operating your Shopping App across your global storefronts is a seamless operation.
Capture your users’ attention directly on their lock screen with Rich Push Notifications. Studio enables your brand to set up on-the-go push campaigns to drive users back to your Shopping App.
What you see is what you get. Rich preview for mobile and tablet mock-ups and preview on your device via QR code ensures everything is in the right place before going live.
Lastly, built-in accessibility tools ensure your brand can reach every user without boundaries.
In Studio, you can also access technical functionalities like clearing the Product Catalog Cache manually or enabling Maintenance Mode.
