Associates can test new or upcoming features of NewStore Associate App by switching to
test mode
in the app. When you switch to test mode, the app switches from a live environment to the staging environment configured for your business. Changes made in test mode do not have any impact on actual sales or live orders in the store.
To enable this feature, talk to your store manager or the IT support team, or see
Enabling switching to test mode
.
Important
Every time you switch to test mode, all locally stored data in the app such as the list of users, saved carts, and IP addresses for Zebra label printers, are removed.
To use this feature, ensure that:
You have the required
permissions
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
You have the credentials to use the app in test mode. For more information, contact your store manager or the
support team
.
Your business has provided you with access credentials for the Adyen test environment, for you to keep using Adyen payment devices in test mode. For more information, contact your store manager or
Adyen support
.
To switch to
test mode
in the app:
Log into <logging-in>
the app.
Tap the navigation drawer menu, and tap
Switch to test mode
>
Switch
.
Once the app restarts, log in again with your assigned credentials for test mode to complete the switch.
Note
The
pin set up
when logging in for the first time expires every time you switch modes in NewStore Associate App.
A banner at the top notifies you that NewStore Associate App is being used in test mode.
To leave test mode and return to the live version of NewStore Associate App, in the top banner, tap
and tap
Leave
