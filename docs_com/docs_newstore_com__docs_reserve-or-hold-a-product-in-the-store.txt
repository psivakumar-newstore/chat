NewStore allows you to reserve products for customers who intend to purchase but cannot complete the transaction immediately, e.g. they are indecisive, currently unavailable or planning a later visit. In these cases the customer commits to purchase within a timeframe (e.g. 24 or 48 hours. Typically predefined by the business) and expect the product to be reserved exclusively for them, shielded from other  in-store or omnichannel demand.
Once a reservation is created, products with the defined units will automatically move from the Main (sellable) inventory to the Customer Reservations (nonsellable)  stock location.
Unreserving is a manual process and the associates need to mark products as unreserved, in order to remove a reservation. When a product is unreserved, the products will automatically move back to the Main stock location.
Note
Available as early access on Associate App v.1.66.0.
