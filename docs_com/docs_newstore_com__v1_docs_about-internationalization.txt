Adding fiscal signatures to receipts
In some countries, you have to print the
Fiscal signature
on the receipts. The requirements for the fiscal signature format and fields depend on the country that a retailer operates in, where
fiscal regulations
apply.
The fiscal signature data is available as a pre-defined property, which can be used for displaying the fiscal signature.
To update the template to include the fiscal signature in the receipt, follow the steps mentioned in
Customizing a template
.
To understand what changes must be made in the template, see the
the tutorial
.
Important
The retailer is responsible for verifying local regulations and ensuring compliance of the receipt.
Receipts created within non-production environments should be marked with an indicator, such as a header text or watermark. The indicator must state that the receipt is not valid and is for testing purposes only. The indicator helps retailers to identify a test receipt and prevents unintended usage of such receipts.
When a retailer performs a transaction in a country that requires fiscalization, a digital signature may be required to be printed on the receipt to comply with
Fiscal regulations
. For more information, See
Adding fiscal signatures to receipts
.
