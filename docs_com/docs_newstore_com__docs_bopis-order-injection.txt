Prerequisites
Complete
Module 1 - Foundational Setup
,
Web Order Injection
and
BOPIS - Pick up options
and additional configuration
Inventory for the test product(s) is loaded for the stores.
The process of creating a Buy Online Pick Up In-Store (BOPIS)
Order
involves two distinct steps:
Step 1: Create Pick Options - Using the customer's cart contents and the
Location
where the customer intends to pick up the order, eCom-NewStore integration should generate pick options
Important
Pass the cart information including the items, Latitude, and Longitude  Generate
In-store pickup
options  API to generate the pickup options.
Normally the customers will enter their zip code/  city+zip code to locate, so the integration should have the additional logic to convert the zip code to latitude, and longitude
The
show_stores_without_atp
flag in the request determines whether to display all stores or only those with Available-to-Promise (ATP) inventory.
Note that:
If
show_stores_without_atp
is set to true, all stores will be displayed, regardless of their ATP status.
If
show_stores_without_atp
is set to false, only stores with ATP inventory will be displayed.
Additionally, it is possible to inject an order even if ATP is not available. However, please be aware that:
Any order lines without ATP will be placed on hold.
Only order lines with sufficient ATP inventory will be routed to the Store for
Picking
and
Packing
.
Step 2: Inject BOPIS Order with the generated pick options from the previous step
Important
The create order API is documented here - Order Injection API | NewStore Documentation
The shipping offer token should be passed in shipping_offer_token the payload.
Upon successful order injection, the order will be routed to the designated Store location, contingent upon the
Remorse period
. However, if the required inventory is unavailable for either a portion or the entire order, the order will be placed on hold, pending further action.
Once the order is successfully sent to the store, the Associate will receive a notification regarding the
Fulfillment request
in the Associate App (AA). The Associate will then utilize the Associate App to fulfill the order, ensuring that the customer's request is completed efficiently and effectively.
