Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage discounts permission.
You can simulate how promotions and coupons or coupon codes will be applied to a cart in Associate App. The
Promotions Simulator
in Omnichannel Manager enables you to experiment with and validate promotions and coupons set up for your business. You can check if these promotions will work in real-world situations when they are applied to a cart in the app.
The
Promotions Simulator
is aimed at reducing the errors and problems with promotions or discount coupons during checkout transactions when live.
Simulating promotions with an example
To simulate promotions:
Go to
Promotions
>
Cart Simulator
.
In the
Promotions Simulator
screen that appears:
In the
Add Products
area, select the catalog and the pricebook currency from the drop-down menu.
Search for the product that you want to apply the promotion to, and click it to add it to the
Cart Simulator
screen on the right.
In the
Coupon codes
area, specify the coupon code for the coupon that should be applied to the products added to the cart.
Note
You can choose to not specify a coupon code to test out automatic promotions or promotions that do not depend on coupons.
(Optional)
In the
Add a customer
area, specify the ID of a customer who will be assigned to the cart.
Note
To get a customer ID, navigate to the
Customers
page in NOM, search for the customer that you want to use, open the customer detail page and copy the ID from the URL as shown in the image.
(Optional)
In the
Select a store
area, specify the ID of a store where the cart will be created.
Note
To get a store ID, navigate to the
Locations
page in NOM, search for the store that you want to use, open the store detail page and copy the ID from the URL as shown in the image.
Click
Apply discounts
.
The discounts from the coupon code specified are now applied to the products in the cart.
If there are automatic promotions applicable for the products you have added, they are also simultaneously applied to these products.
Any coupon codes that are invalid or inactive are not applied. A relevant error message is displayed in the
Cart Simulator
screen, along with a
Discount forbidden
flag. Change or update the coupon code to fix the simulation.
