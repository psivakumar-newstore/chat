Troubleshooting Login Issues
(Excluding Password Errors)
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager (NOM)
Why This Happens
Sometimes, login issues can occur due to outdated authentication tokens, conflicts in your browser's cache or cookies, or interference from browser extensions. You might see problems like blank pages or pages that fail to load properly.
To resolve these issues, follow the steps below.
1.
Try an Incognito or Private Browsing Session
Using an "incognito" or "private" session helps bypass your browser’s saved data, such as cache or extensions, which could be causing conflicts. Here's how to open a private session in different browsers:
Chrome
:
Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: Ctrl + Shift + n
Mac: ⌘ + Shift + n
Mozilla Firefox
:
Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: Ctrl + Shift + p
Mac: ⌘ + Shift + p
Microsoft Edge
:
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + n
If this resolves the issue, the problem is likely due to cached data or an extension. If the issue persists, proceed to the next step.
2.
Refresh the Page with a Hard Reload
Forcing a hard refresh can help if the page is failing to load due to cached content.
Chrome/Firefox/Edge
:
Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: Ctrl + Shift + r
Mac: ⌘ + Shift + r
If the page loads correctly after the refresh, your cache might have been the issue. If not, continue to the next steps.
3.
Clear Browser Cache and Cookies
Clearing your browser's local data can help resolve more persistent issues. Here’s how to do it:
Chrome
:
Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: Ctrl + Shift + delete
Mac: ⌘ + Shift + backspace
Alternatively, navigate to chrome://settings/clearBrowserData in the address bar.
Mozilla Firefox
:
Windows, Linux, Chrome OS: Ctrl + Shift + delete
Mac: ⌘ + Shift + backspace
Microsoft Edge
:
Windows: Ctrl + Shift + delete
In each case:
Choose "All time" for the time range (if unsure).
Ensure "Cookies and other site data" is selected.
Uncheck "Browsing History" if you don’t want to lose your history.
Click
"Clear data."
4.
Double-Check Your Bookmarked URL
Occasionally, incorrect URLs saved in bookmarks can cause issues. Make sure your bookmark points to the correct login page:
https://manager.<customer>.p.newstore.net/login
If your bookmark ends with something like /sales/orders, try navigating directly to /login instead.

Troubleshooting Steps
5.
Record a HAR File for Support
If clearing the cache and other basic troubleshooting steps don’t resolve your issue, you may need to generate a HAR file for NewStore Support to investigate.
Important:
A HAR file may contain sensitive data like login credentials or session cookies. Be sure to sanitize the file before sharing it.
Follow these steps to generate a HAR file:
Open Developer Tools
:
Right-click on the login page and select
"Inspect"
to open the Developer Tools panel.
Go to the Network Tab
:
In the Developer Tools, select the
"Network"
tab. Ensure the activity is being recorded (you’ll see a red dot in the corner if it is).
Reproduce the Issue
:
Try to log in and reproduce the issue you're encountering. The Developer Tools will capture network activity.
Export the HAR File
:
After the issue occurs, click
"Export HAR"
in the Developer Tools. This file will be saved in your downloads folder.
Sanitize the HAR File
:
Before sending it to NewStore Support, remove any sensitive information. We recommend using
this online tool
to sanitize the file.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to resolve most login issues with the NewStore Omnichannel Manager. If the problem persists after completing these troubleshooting steps, don’t hesitate to contact NewStore Support with a sanitized HAR file for further assistance.
