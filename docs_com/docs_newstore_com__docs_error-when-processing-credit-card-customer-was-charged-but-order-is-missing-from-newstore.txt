Guidance for Associates on Troubleshooting Credit Card Sale Errors: Confirming Payment Status with the System
An error occurred when processing a Credit Card sale. Where can I find the
Order
and provide the Customer with a Receipt?
As an Associate, sometimes an Order will be placed, payment is captured, and yet the Associate App(AA) has a problem synchronizing the Sale between the Payment Provider and NewStore.  When this happens, you may get an error on the AA and an Order Id is not generated in the AA or in NOM, even though the Customer's payment was captured.
First you can double-check that the Order is indeed missing from NewStore logging into NOM and by viewing the most recent Orders in NOM
or by searching for the Customer in NOM,
then clicking the Email to view that Customer's purchase history
I still cannot find my Order! Who can help me?
If after a minute or two, and you still cannot see the Order in NOM, you can contact NewStore Support.  If the payment was indeed captured and the customer was charged, then NewStore Support should be able to finish placing the Order, so that it appears in NOM/AA and receipt can be given to the Customer.
When contacting Support about an error occurring during checkout while processing a Credit Card, which results in an Order not being created, please send them the following information:
Date and Time the Order was placed
Customer name and email
Total Amount
Store
Location
and Associate's name and email that was logged-in and placed the Order
Screenshot/Picture or Video of Error (a description of the error is nice, but a picture is worth 1,000 words)
Steps to Reproduce (was a
Discount
applied, gift card, split payment, etc)
If you provide as much as information as possible during the initial ticket, Support may be able to provide a quick solution.
(Also Sales order, Sale, Purchase)
