To check availability for a product across locations in your business:
Go to
Catalog
>
Stock Levels
.
Type the product SKU or the name of the product, in the search bar and press Enter. The
Location
and
ATP
columns display the stock levels across your stores and distribution centers.
Based on inventory transactions such as receiving inventory, transfers, adjustments, or customer returns, NewStore updates the ATP for such items in the store.
To sort the products in the search results by a column, click the column header. Specify additional criteria to sort by a size, color, location, price range, on hand stock, safety stock, ATP quantity, item reservations and allocations. Each header you click is added to the current filter as filter criterion.
Note
The
Stock Levels
page does not differentiate the products based on stores and locales and displays data from the most recent import. It means that the stock levels can have data from different stores and locales.
Important
The time to show updated numbers on the
Stock Levels
page depends on how many ATP values are affected and if data from other tenants is processed in parallel. Furthermore, concurrently running catalog imports can also affect the time to show ATP updates. It can take up to multiple hours until updated numbers appear on this page.
Stock column descriptions
Note
Columns
In Stock
,
Current ATP
,
Future ATP
and
Total ATP
will display
0
if their value turns negative.
Product name
: The name of the product.
Product ID
: The product ID of the item. If the product ID is the same as the SKU in your business, you'll see the same identifier in both fields. This field is not displayed in the
Stock Levels
page and not included in the export, if it is not configured for display for your business.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To add the product ID to the export, see
Displaying product ID
.
SKU
: The identifier of the product.
Size
: The size of the product.
Color
: The main color of the product.
Price
: The price of the product.
Location
: The ID of the
location
that sells this product.
In Stock
: The
stock
. This is the quantity of the item that was available for sale at the location, on the date and time of the last inventory sync displayed in
Last Stock Import
.
Learn more about stock imports.
Reserved
: The quantity of this item earmarked by routing to ensure successful fulfillment for omnichannel orders at the location. A reservation turns into an allocation once the order is routed to the location for fulfillment.
Learn more about how order items are routed.
Allocated
: The quantity of this item allocated by routing to ensure successful fulfillment for omnichannel orders at the location.
Learn more about how order items are routed.
Safety Stock
: The quantity of this item that is not included in the ATP and is set aside purely for in-store sales.
Learn more about the safety stock.
Current ATP
: The real-time quantity that is available at the location, to be routed for fulfillment. This number is calculated by subtracting the sum of all
reservations
,
allocations
, and
safety stock
quantity from the stock.
Future ATP
: The quantity of this item that will be available at the location on a specified future date. The value of this column is based on
future inventory
for the item at the fulfillment location. When setting up preorders for your business, use future inventory to determine the number of products that can be sold as preorders before the product becomes available for sale.
See how to manage preorders.
Future Availability Date
: The date when the quantity of items specified in
Future ATP
will be available for delivery at the fulfillment location.
Total ATP
: The total quantity of items available, including both real-time (specified in
Current ATP
) and in the future (specified in
Future ATP
).
Note
When a fulfillment location is disabled for order fulfillment, you may see that the
Total ATP
is 0 despite the
In Stock
value being greater than 0. This is expected as the store's stock is not being considered for omnichannel orders when fulfillment is disabled.
Last Stock Import
: The date and time when the last stock import was performed.
Important
If NewStore is
inventory master
in the store, this column displays
-
. If the store switches from using an ERP as inventory master to using NewStore, the date and time is removed after ATP is updated for the product. For more information on how
stock on hand
and ATP are updated when NewStore is inventory master, see
Choosing your inventory master
.
Last Mispick
: The last time this item was
mispicked
. Provide a date range to see the products that were mispicked within the specified duration. The status of a mispick is updated and
-
is displayed in the following cases:
After a
cycle count
inventory operation
When stock on hand for the product is updated in the store
Note
When NewStore is inventory master, stock on hand is updated based on
inventory operations
in the store. When an ERP is inventory master, stock on hand is updated when stock is imported into the store or DC.
Monitoring stock for mispicked items
The
Catalog
>
Mispicked Stock
page displays products that were
mispicked
via NewStore Associate App. Provide a date range to see if the product was mispicked within the specified duration.
After a mispick, values change in the following way:
Safety Stock
and
In Stock
: The values set for both these columns for the specified location remain unchanged.
ATP
: Set to
0
till the next stock update.
Stock updates like the following transactions in the store will update the ATP for the mispicked items:
Receiving transactions, transfers, and adjustments in inventory
Customer returns
Allocated
: The quantity allocated to the mispicked items is reduced.
Managing safety stock
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage safety stock permission.
The
Catalog
>
Stock Levels
page displays
safety stock
of products across your stores and distribution centers.
When you update safety stock for a store, it affects the
In Stock
and
Total ATP
values. You can check their latest values in the
Stock Levels
page after importing safety stock. It may take up to multiple hours until updated numbers appear on this page, depending on the size of the safety stock file and if data from other fulfillment locations or tenants is processed in parallel.
When you don't define store locations in the safety stock CSV file, upon import the safety stock is updated in the platform for across locations in your business.
Exporting safety stock
You can export a safety stock CSV file from NewStore Omnichannel Manager to view and update safety stock levels for a store.
To export safety stock:
Go to the
Catalog > Stock Levels
page.
Click
Export Safety Stock
.
A
safety-stock-export.csv
file is downloaded. You can make changes to this file and
import
the updated CSV file into NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
The CSV file contains stock-level information, which is displayed in the
Stock Levels
page, such as product IDs, store locations, safety stock quantity, and so on.
Important
The file contains only products for which safety stock was previously imported.
See this
example CSV
for more information. You can upload a new or updated CSV file with a maximum size of 10 MB.
Importing safety stock
You can update safety stock levels for products in a store by importing a CSV file into NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
To import safety stock:
Go to the
Catalog > Stock Levels
page.
Click
Import Safety Stock
.
In the
Import
dialog box that appears, select a CSV file for upload.
Refer to this
example CSV
to create or update CSV files for importing safety stock data.
Click
Import
to continue importing the safety stock in the NewStore platform.
The status of the import appears on the screen.
You can also use the
Stock API
to programmatically export or import safety stock, and check the status of a safety stock import.
Important
The time to update ATP depends on the size of the safety stock file, how many products are affected, and if data from other fulfillment locations or tenants is processed in parallel. It can take up to multiple hours until updated numbers appear on this page.
