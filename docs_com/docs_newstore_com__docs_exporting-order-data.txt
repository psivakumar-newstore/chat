Important
The structure of the CSV file or the column names can be updated by NewStore at any time. Consider this if you rely on this file for integration purposes.
You can export orders as a CSV file. The exported CSV file contains all order details including the products in the order, the order status, fulfillment information, the time and timezone in which the order was placed, external identifiers for the items in the order (if configured), the associate who placed the order, shipping details, prices and discounts applied, payment information, the tax calculation method, and return reasons (if any).
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Export orders permission.
Set the filters to display the orders you want.
For example, you can set filters to only display the orders from yesterday to today and at a specific location.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
The filtered data is based on the default timezone configured for the tenant, even if the user's local timezone is enabled in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. See
