Enabling or disabling a store for order fulfillment
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Edit fulfillment availability permission.
Click
Locations
in the top menu.
Under
Store Label
, click the store that you want to enable or disable order fulfillment from.
In the store details page, in the left pane, turn on the
Accept Fulfillment Orders
toggle to enable order fulfillment in the store.
To disable the store from fulfilling orders, turn the
Accept Fulfillment Orders
toggle off. Orders routed to the location before it was disabled are fulfilled via the usual process. Use NewStore Associate App to reject these orders if needed.
Important
Once a location is disabled from fulfilling orders, ATP for products at the location is reset to
0
within a time span of 12 hours.
The time to show updated numbers on the
Stock Levels
page depends on the volume of products for which ATP must be reset, and if data from other tenants is processed in parallel. Furthermore, concurrently running catalog imports can also affect the time to show ATP updates. It can take up to multiple hours until updated numbers appear on this page.
When a location is disabled from fulfilling orders,
-
is displayed for the respective location in the
Fulfillment Location
column.
