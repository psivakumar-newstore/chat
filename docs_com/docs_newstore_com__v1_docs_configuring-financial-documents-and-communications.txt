Configuring financial documents
You can configure financial documents generated via the NewStore platform for your business operations. This includes:
Configuring the format of the number generated in invoice documents during checkout.
Specifying the address information that is included in financial documents generated for your business.
To view the current configuration for financial documents set up for your business, use the
Get financial documents config
method.
To configure financial documents:
Use the
Update financial documents config
method or
Create financial documents config
method.
To specify the address information that will be included in the generated financial documents, in
accounting_settings
>
accounting_entities
:
In
accounting_address
, specify the address information.
(Optional)
In
id
, specify the country code value, such as
US
for an address that is based in USA.
This allows the address information you have specified in
accounting_address
for financial documents to be distinct for each region in your business.
To specify the format of the invoice ID to be included in the financial documents generated for your business, in
accounting_settings
>
generate_external_invoice_id_format
, specify the format.
The recommended format is
{tenant}{country_code}{unique_number:08d}
, where:
tenant
is the first 3 characters of the environment value of the tenant for your business, such as
pro
for the
production
environment.
country_code
is the country code for the region for which you are generating an invoice ID, such as
US
for USA or
DE
for Germany.
unique_number:08d
is a unique number generated for your business, which is unique to your business when generating financial documents.
Configuring financial communications
NewStore enables you to configure the type of notifications and communication that are sent automatically to customers in your business. This may include receipts and other financial documents and communications.
To view the current configuration for financial communications set up for your business, use the
Get financial communications config
method.
To configure financial communications for your business:
Use the
Update financial communications config
method or
Create financial communications config
method.
Set the
push_notification_channel_type
property to associate a channel to send push notification to the customer's device. Set the value for this property to
customer_uuid
or customer
email
to specify which channel type to use for sending push notifications.
In the
options
property, set each of the properties to either
email
or
push_nottification
, based on how you want the customer to receive notifications and financial documents.
If set to
email
, NewStore sends the communication to the customer's email. If set to
push_notification
, NewStore sends the communication to the customer as push notifications on their device.
Note
If you want the customer to receive communication via both email and push notifications, specify both values for the relevant properties.
The following properties must be set up:
gift_card.issued
: For NewStore to send communication about issued gift cards to the customer.
invoice_created
: For NewStore to send communication about invoices for orders to the customer.
refund_note_created
: For NewStore to send communication about refund notes that have been created for returns that the customer has made for their orders.
