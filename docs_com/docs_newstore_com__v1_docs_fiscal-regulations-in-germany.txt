According to the German Cash Register Security Regulation (KassenSichV), a certified TSE (
Technische Sicherheitseinrichtung
, or a Technical Safety System) must be used for all cash register systems operating in Germany.
Retailers can operate on the NewStore platform in Germany in compliance with KassenSichV, via integrations with:
fiskaltrust Germany
(a middleware partner), and
fiskaly
(a cloud TSE provider)
fiskaly Cloud TSE is used for signing transactions that are processed through fiskaltrust Germany.
NewStore platform does not have a direct integration with fiskaly.

In stores operating in Germany, a store must be fiscally activated before orders can be created via NewStore Associate app.
Fiscal cashbox activation
The fiscal cashbox activation process in Germany includes the following steps:
