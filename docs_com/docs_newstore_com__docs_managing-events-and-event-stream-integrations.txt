NewStore allows you to receive near real-time data from the NewStore platform via NewStore
Event Stream
. The event stream consists of all the
events
emitted by the
entities
of the platform. Each event contains data that can be integrated, persisted and aggregated in your data warehouse.
Entity
: Represents a business concept that emits events. Example:
order
,
return
or
fulfillment request
.
Event
: Represents a key moment of the life time of an entity. Example:
order created
,
order canceled
or
fulfillment request assigned
. All the events are described in detail in the
Event stream webhooks
documentation.
For more information on Event Stream and how it works with integrations at NewStore, see the
integration guide
.
Omnichannel Manager allows you to view all your integrations set up to work with Event Stream, and also allows you to create new integrations that can consume NewStore events for data aggregation and processing.
Viewing integrations
To view all existing Event Stream integrations that you have set up for your business, log into NOM and go to
Tools
>
Event Stream
. All integrations are displayed in the
All
section.
To view all active Event Stream integrations, click
Active
, and to view all paused or inactive Event Stream integrations, click
Paused
.
To switch an Event Stream integration to
Active
state or to
Pause
it, click the toggle button on the right for the relevant integration.
To delete an Event stream integration, click
Delete
for the relevant integration.
Viewing integration events and logs
For every integration, you can view the list of events involved in the integration, including rejected events, and the logs for the integration.
Viewing events
For an Event stream integration, from the
Actions
drop-down menu, click
View Events
. The list of events published by NewStore for the integration is displayed. This list can be filtered by the
Domain Entity ID
, the status of the event, as well as a specific time period.
The page has the following columns:
Event
: The ID and type of event, such as
471278c7-dee8-4de5-8383-d8e50ede1c3f
as the ID and
fulfillment_request.assigned
as the type of event.
Domain Entity ID
: The domain-specific ID of the event in the platform. For example, for orders this is specified as the order ID.
Status
: Can either be
Success
or
Failure
, based on whether the event was emitted successfully by the platform or not.
Attempted at
: The time when the event was emitted by the platform.
Viewing and replaying rejected events
To view events rejected by your integration, click the
Actions
drop-down menu of your integration and select
View Rejected Events
. The page displays a list of events that were rejected by the ERP or data warehouse configured to consume events emitted by NewStore. You can use this information to audit events that were missing or not processed in your integration and replay them.
This functionality is especially helpful when events fail due to transient network issues, incorrect mappings, or endpoint misconfigurations that have since been resolved.
The
Rejected Events
page includes the following columns:
ID
: The unique identifier of the rejected event.
Note
This does not match the
ID
of the original event.
Attempted at
: The timestamp when the event was rejected.
Inspect & Replay
: Click this button to view the event details or to replay the event if needed.
Viewing integration logs
For an Event stream integration, from the
Actions
drop-down menu, click
View Logs
. The logs for the integration are displayed, which includes these columns:
Action
: Displays whether the integration was stopped or started.
Reason
: Why and how the integration was started or stopped.
Created at
: The time when the log for the integration was created.
Creating a new integration
To create an Event Stream integration, click
New Integration
and follow these steps:
In the
Integration Details
area:
In
Integration ID
, specify a unique ID for the integration.
In
Integration Type
, specify if the integration is
Permanent
or
Temporary
.
Note
A
Permanent
integration has no
End Date
specified, but a
Temporary
integration will stop consuming events on a specific date.
In the
Events
area, select the preferred events you want the integration to consume as emitted by NewStore, and make available for viewing in NOM later.
For example, select
order
to add all (currently supported) order related events, or select specific order events such as
order.created
and
order.completed
from the list.
Note
You can add as many events as you want to an integration, but we recommend that for each integration, you only add relevant and related events to make it easier to audit and view later. For example, create an integration that consumes all
order
and
return
related events, and a separate integration that consumes all
fulfillment_request
related events.
In the
Integration Target
area, select the integration target that will consume events. This can be either a
Webhook
or an AWS
S3
bucket. See
this guide
for more information on which integration target to choose.
For a webhook, specify the
Callback URL
and the required
API Key
for the integration to be able to consumer and retain events.
For an AWS S3 bucket, specify the
AWS Access Key
,
AWS Secret Key
,
AWS Region
, the name of the S3 bucket in
S3 Bucket Name
, and the
Key Prefix
.
Click
Create
to finish setting up the integration and start consuming NewStore events.
Selecting the right integration target
We recommend using AWS S3 buckets to deliver events, and S3 as the default option when possible. NewStore prepares events in batches, which are delivered when they either total 50 megabytes in size, or 5 minutes have elapsed since the previous batch was sent. This allows the S3 integration target to send large amounts of events to your data warehouse with a manageable latency. The more events you have, the faster you'll get them.
HTTP webhooks have a performance target to be delivered within 15 minutes, but the vast majority of events are delivered within only a few seconds. This makes the integration type most suitable for lower volumes of events that you want to process as soon as possible. As event volumes increase, your capacity to receive them must increase too. NewStore uses limited concurrency to send multiple events in parallel. However, the connection latency limits the amount of total events NewStore can send per second, before delays start building up.
Updating an existing integration
To update an existing integration, from the
Actions
drop-down menu, click
Edit Integration Details
.
When updating an integration, you can only update the events you want to consume and the AWS or webhook details, based on what you chose as an integration target space when creating the integration.
