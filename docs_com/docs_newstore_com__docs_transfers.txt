Enabling inventory transfers
documentation to enable count feature
Inventory transfers enable the movement of sellable and non-sellable inventory between store locations, including distribution centers (DCs). The platform supports two primary
Transfer
processes:
Headquarters-planned transfers
: Retailers create transfer requests within their
Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) system, which are then integrated into the platform.
Store-planned transfers
: Store associates initiate transfers directly through the mobile application, selecting relevant items for transfer.
Shipping and inventory updates
The platform integrates with shipping carriers to generate shipping labels for packaged transfers. Alternatively, retailers can choose to ship transfers without labels.
Once the transfer is packed:
On-hand inventory
updates to reflect the transferred quantity.
Available-to-Promise (ATP)
recalculates based on the updated inventory levels.
API
If the retailer opts to create transfers within NewStore, they can do so directly from the Associate App. Alternatively, if they prefer to initiate the transfer from their ERP system, they can use the
Create Transfer
API
to submit a transfer request. This includes specifying the source store, destination details, and the associated items for the transfer.
NewStore supports completing a transfer either with or without generating a shipping label. If the retailer wants to enable shipping label generation as part of the transfer process, they should use the
Create or Update Transfer Shipping Configuration
API to configure the necessary shipping settings.
The movement of inventory from one store to another store or warehouse/distribution center. See the
