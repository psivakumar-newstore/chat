Use the
Event stream
to sync inventory back to external systems after in-store inventory management operations have been completed.
When you sync inventory with the following transactions,
ATP
is updated in the NewStore platform and also on the
Catalog > Stock Levels
page in NewStore Omnichannel Manager:
Receiving transactions
Transfers
Adjustments
Cycle counts
Customer returns
Syncing inventory after a receiving transaction
Implement the
Publish event
method and listen to the
inventory_transaction.items_received
event.
Note
All products received into the store are included in the event.
Inventory is received against an order reference and/or a shipment reference such as an
ASN
. If the event contains items that were not in the reference, reconcile this difference in your external systems.
For details on the event payload, see the
Inventory transaction items received
example in the API reference.
Syncing stock on hand after a cycle count
Implement the
Publish event
method and listen to the
inventory_count.items_counted
event.
The
stock_on_hand
property in the event is the quantity that is on record for the product, at the location. This value is calculated by the NewStore platform. You can view the available stock on hand for your store in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
The
count
property in the event contains the actual quantity of the product physically present at the store at the time of the cycle count.
For details on the event payload, see the
Inventory items counted
example in the API reference.
Note
You can sync inventory back to an
ERP
system to reconcile the
stock on hand
data for a retailer. Use the
Stock on hand
APIs to retrieve stock quantities of products from a store across all stock locations.
Syncing inventory after a transfer transaction
Implement the
Publish event
method and listen to the
inventory_transaction.items_ready_for_handover
and
inventory_transaction.asn_created
events.
All products transferred from the store are included in the events, including the quantity of the products transferred and the destination of the transfer.
Inventory is transferred against an order reference such as a
transfer order
. A transfer ASN is created, which is used to receive the transferred inventory at the destination of the transfer. Reconcile this difference in your external systems.
For details on the event payload, see the
Inventory transaction items ready for handover
and
Inventory transaction ASN created
examples in the API reference.
Syncing inventory after an adjustment transaction
Implement the
Publish event
method and listen to the
inventory_transaction.adjustment_created
event. All products adjusted in the store are included in the event. These adjustment transactions may include:
Adjustments made to the inventory.
The quantity of products moved to or from another
stock location
after an adjustment transaction.
Note
To configure stock locations for your business, use the
Create stock location
method.
Notes about the adjustment transaction.
Inventory is adjusted against an adjustment type, such as
Damage out
or
Repaired
.
Inventory adjustment is internal to the store, so no references are used for these transactions. Reconcile any differences in your external systems.
For details on the event payload, see the
Inventory transaction adjustment created
example in the API reference.
