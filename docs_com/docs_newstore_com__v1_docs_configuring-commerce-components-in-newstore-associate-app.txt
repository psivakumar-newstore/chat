To configure the following commerce components in NewStore Associate App, use the NewStore Associate App
Configuration API
.
Use the
Get app configuration
method to retrieve the current configuration for NewStore Associate App in your business.
Configuring barcode types
Specify the barcode types such as
EAN13
or
QR
, among others, which can be scanned via Associate App. You can also specify
CodeTypeAll
, which enables the app to scan all barcode types supported by NewStore.
Important
Configure at least one barcode type to enable associates to use Associate App.
Ensure that the barcode type
QR
is configured for associates to be able to scan QR codes containing an
EPC
(Electronic Product Code).
QR codes in the
01/{GTIN}/21/{serial}
and
/{model}/{variation}/{epc}
formats are supported.
When using an EPC code, only 1 item can be added to a cart at a time, irrespective of using the scanner or the quantity picker.
The serial number is decoded from the EPC and carried in the external ID called SN, which is exposed to third parties with the external events.
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
commerce_components
>
barcode_types
, specify the barcodes that can be scanned via NewStore Associate App.
Configuring gift cards as products
To enable retailers to sell
gift card
s as products during checkout in NewStore Associate App, you must:
Configure the product ID
Configure the regular expression
Products that match the product ID and the regular expression are identified as gift cards in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud. See
Selling gift cards
.
Configuring the product ID of the gift card
To add the product ID of a gift card in NewStore Associate App:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
commerce_components
>
gift_card_product_id
, specify the product ID. For example
2000081
.
Configuring the regular expression of the gift card
To add the regular expression of a gift card in NewStore Associate App:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
commerce_components
>
gift_card_regexp
, specify the expression. For example,
^(\\d{12})$
.
Important
The regular expression matching is
NOT case-sensitive
, which means
^([a-z]*)$
will be matched with both
abc
and
ABC
. Associates might type in lower or upper case letters when manually entering a gift card number. The integration must handle situations where the gift card provider requires the gift card number typed in a specific case.
To correctly extract the gift card's serial from the scanned barcode, provide a
capture group
. You can capture the whole number or just part of it depending on your integration. An expression like
^SVS_GC-(\\d{15})$
will match all scanned codes that start with
SVS_GC-
but only extract the number following this pattern as the actual gift card number.
