You can set up cash transactions in stores across your business that do not impact sales directly, but influences the daily cash summary or
float
in the store.
Associates can use these transactions in NewStore Associate App to manage the inflow or outflow of cash in the store. For example, when enabled, an associate can transfer cash from another drawer in the store to the drawer the associate is working with, and use the
transfer_in
transaction in NewStore Associate App to indicate that cash was added to the drawer balance or
float
.
Important
This feature is enabled globally for all stores, and cannot be set for one specific store in your business.
