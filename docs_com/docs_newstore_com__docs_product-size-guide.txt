The app can display a size guide on the product detail view. This is done through the use of a web view. A web view is essentially a simple web browser that can be launched from the app and is used to display web content within the app. In order to show the size guide a publicly accessible url is required. This url can be static or dynamic. In the case of a static url the same size guide will be shown for every product. In the case of a dynamic url the size guide can be different. There are a few different options to provide Newstore with a url to the size guide.
1. Newstore configures a static url within the app's configuration. This url is provided by you during onboarding and can be changed at a later date if necessary. This will mean the size guide is the same for every product. eg
https://www.brand.com/sizeguide
2. Newstore configures a static url within the app's configuration however when actually requesting the url in the app a product id is added as a parameter. This allows you to change the contents of the size guide based on the product id. eg
https://www.brand.com/sizeguide?product_id=123
3. You add the url of the size guide as a custom attribute to each product. This allows you to be in complete control of what sizeguide is shown for each product eg "c_hs_sizeguide": "<
https://www.brand.com/any/url/you/want
>"
