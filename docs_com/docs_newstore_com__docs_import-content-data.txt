The process of importing data into the NewStore platform is described in this section. This guide explains the content and formatting of content of the import.
The import must have at least 1 file, but can also contain as many as 1000 files. However, each file is processed separately, depending on how the data is split into different files, and the dependencies between them. This can impact the whole platform and the import jobs in queue.
Note
NewStore always recommends merging all the information together in the same files as much as possible.
The files submitted in an import, belong to four entities:
product
,
category
,
price
,
availability
. Each entity has a different
json
format. The schema and the explanation of each field is described in the following sections:
Product
