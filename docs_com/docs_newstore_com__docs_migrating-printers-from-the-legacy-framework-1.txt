Use this guide to migrate printers in your store from the legacy framework to the new framework in Associate App.
Migration options
To migrate printers to the new framework, use one of these 2 methods:
Use the
printers API
to programmatically set up new printers.
Use the built-in
printer management
in Associate App to manually set up new printers.
Note
To use only AirPrint printers, use the
Update app configuration
method and set
capabilities
>
printer_management
>
air_print
to
true
.
To use Star printers, set the correct
star_print_resolution
, otherwise the resolution defaults to
200DPI
. Use the
Update app configuration
method and set
capabilities
>
printer_management
>
star_print_resolution
to a printer resolution of your choice.
Migrating printers using the printers API
Depending on the type of printer you want to migrate, you must set up certain configuration properties. Verify the existing configuration properties for your business using the
legacy printers API
before you continue.
You have to provide specific data during the printer migration process, such as a
networkName
for AirPrint printers, or an
identifier
and
interfaceType
for Star printers. As the new printer framework supports more
documentTypes
, ensure that you define printers and their output documents before starting the migration.
This table describes the configuration properties required for a successful printing framework migration based on the printer type. You can learn more about configuration properties from the
printers API
schema.
