Configuring Offline Mode in fiscal countries
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage Associate App permission.
Important
Only users with the
Admin
role or the
Manage Associate App
permission assigned to them can enable this feature for your business. When enabling the feature, they are also required to acknowledge and accept the risk and liability associated with processing offline orders without fiscalization in place.
If required for your business, you can configure the use of
Offline Mode
in Associate App for specific fiscal countries. When using the app offline, orders are processed according to the configured fiscal signing strategy for the originating store's country.
The fiscal signing strategies vary between the supported fiscal countries based on the rules and regulations of each country. You can find a detailed explanation of each signing strategy's behavior in the
Manage Offline Mode Settings In Fiscal Countries
configuration page in the Omnichannel Manager.
To ensure the validity of the specified taxes for orders created in offline mode in fiscal countries, tax recalculation is performed for all such offline orders. This is done while the orders are being uploaded to the NewStore platform.
The taxes of the order is recalculated while respecting the following:
The net and tax amounts of the items may be modified.
The gross amount of the items should not be modified.
The gross amount paid for the order should not be modified.
In the scenario of external tax provider failures (such as network issues, or the external tax provider being down)
An error message is displayed to the associate explaining the reason of the failure.
The associate can retry uploading the order via Associate App.
Note
Offline orders tax recalculation uses the tax strategy configured for your business or the specific store. For more information see the
Configuring tax calculation settings
.

Configuring Adyen payment devices to accept offline payments
To set up Adyen payment devices or terminals to accept offline payments via NewStore Associate App, contact Adyen support and request to enable
Standalone Mode
for the terminals.
Important
For standalone payments, use supported terminals with a built-in printer, such as:
S1F2
V210
V400c Plus
V400m
As a NewStore customer, if you use terminals that do not have a built-in printer, such as the e285, e355, and V400m, request Adyen support to disable receipt printing for these terminals when enabling offline payments.
Enabling offline catalogs
Product validation in offline mode can be enabled to avoid the risk of scanning or entering a wrong UPC or SKU.
Note
If this configuration is enabled, Associate App downloads a compressed version of the catalog after a user logs in. The app downloads the catalog again only when the local catalog is out of date.
To enable this feature:
Offline catalog is generated automatically once a day, make sure you imported all needed items 24h before.
Use the
Update app configuration
method to set
capabilities
>
offline_mode_catalog_backup
to
true
. This configures the app to download the offline catalog daily.
