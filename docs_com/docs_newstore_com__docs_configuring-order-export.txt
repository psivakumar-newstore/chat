You can configure NewStore Omnichannel Manager to include extended attributes in the order export.
The following extended attributes can be included as part of the export:
Extended order attributes
Extended order item attributes
Note
The exported data depends on the extended attributes that have been added to the order during order placement/injection.
To view the configuration for order attribute export set up for your business, use the
Get order export configuration
method.
Exporting extended attributes
Within the export in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, the extended order and order item attributes are represented as:
Label
: A human readable label to be shown as the row header in the export.
Name
: The extended attribute data that is included as part of the export.
There can be multiple extended order and extended order item attributes configured via the NewStore Omnichannel Manager configuration API and included in the export.
To configure exports in NewStore Omnichannel Manager:
Use the
Create order export configuration
method.
In the
order_export
>
orderExtendedAttributes
property:
Set
label
to an intuitive human-readable name.
Set
name
to the extended order attribute.
In the
order_export
> or
orderItemExtendedAttributes
property:
Set
label
to an intuitive human-readable name.
Set
name
to the extended order item attribute.
Extended attributes are included in the export only if the attributes have been added during order placement/injection.
Exporting external identifiers
To configure exports to include external identifiers:
Use the
Create order export configuration
method.
In the
order_export
>
orderItemExternalIdentifiers
.
Set
label
to an intuitive human-readable name.
Set
name
to the external identifier that is used in your business. For example,
sku
or

.
