A product is imported into a
shop
and for a specific
locale
. In NewStore Omnichannel Cloud, a
shop
is a hierarchical entity that can contain products, categories, and prices. It is not a physical store. The product details that you provide during import determine the product attributes that are displayed in NewStore applications.
To define a user-friendly name for your
shop
, use the
shop_display_name
or the
head
element of the product import, such as
Catalog Europe
. The value you specify here is visible to users as the identifier for the combination of a
shop
and the related
locale
in your business, where products will be imported into during the import process.
In the
head
section of the product import payload, use
shop_display_name
to specify a user-friendly name for a
shop
in your business, such as
Catalog Europe
or
Catalog North America
. The value you specify here is visible to users as the identifier for the combination of a
shop
and the related
locale
in your business, where products will be imported into during the import process.
The value specified for
shop_display_name
is also displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager in the catalog drop-down list in the
Catalog
tab in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, see
Searching for and filtering products
.
The
shop_display_name
is also displayed when you select products or catalogs to apply
automatic promotions
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Tutorial to define a user-friendly name for
shop
Follow the
product import tutorial
, but use this payload as
products.json
instead.

    ]
}
Follow the rest of the tutorial as described.
Grouping products
A product with variants can be grouped with others through
Variant Groups
. When a group of products shares the same
variant_group_id
attribute, they will be displayed as a group, grouping all the possible variations. This is also valid for the product listing API resources, through the attribute
variations
.
For example, Grace Sweater Beige Size 4 and Grace Sweater Beige Size 6 are both variants of the same product and should be grouped with a
variant_group_id
. Ensure that the same product is not assigned to multiple variant groups in a shop. Even if a product has only one variant, create a variant group to contain the single variant of the product.
To enable variants for color and size, use the attributes
variation_color_value
and
variation_size_value
respectively. This way a selection of possible variants in NewStore Associate App is possible.
Categories
Categories define a hierarchical grouping of products. They are shown when browsing for the product, to make finding the product easier for the associate or customer. Categories can also used to
create an automatic promotion
that apply to all
Tops
in your business, or to all
T-shirts
in your business.
Categories
are imported with the product import into a
shop
and for a specific
locale
. Product categories may vary across different
sales channels
.
If you are importing more than one category, use the
categories
>
is_main
property to specify the main category for the product. This category is displayed against relevant products in the
Catalog
tab in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, see
Searching for and filtering products
.
You can specify multiple categories for a product, using the
categories
property of the product import schema.
To specify the main category for the product, set
is_main
to
true
. This category is displayed against relevant products in the
Catalog
tab in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, see
Searching for and filtering products
.
Important
You cannot specify more than one category as the main category. Also, if no main category is specified, the products are imported but you will not be able to find these products when you filter them by one of these categories.
Importing categories
Categories can also be explicitly imported through the import mechanism. As categories are already imported with the product import, importing categories separately is only required if:
The categories need to be visible in the Associate App, in
Catalog > Browse > Categories
.
The categories need to be accessible via the
List categories
method.
Pictures and a description for each category must be added and sorting sub-categories has to be enabled.
Products need to be fetched via the
List products method
.
File format to import categories
The
path
property identifies the category. The path is a resolved display name, which means that each locale that you define will have a different set of paths.
When importing categories separately, the parent category is displayed in Omnichannel Manager against the relevant products. For example, for a product that is imported with the category
All > Bags > Accessories > Wallets
, the main category displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager is
Bags
.
When importing a whole tree of categories, ensure that you include all individual levels in your imports. Otherwise, not all the different levels will be accessible when
listing categories
.
For example, when importing a category like
Womens > Footwear > Sandals
, you must include
Womens
and
Womens > Footwear
to be able to browse these categories.
