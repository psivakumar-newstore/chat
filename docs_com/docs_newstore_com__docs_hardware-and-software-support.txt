NewStore Associate App - iOS compatibility
NewStore supports the current and one previous version of iOS for all NewStore applications. In general, NewStore recommends updating the
iOS version
within 3 months of its release.
NewStore
only
provides support for the latest app version released. For details on NewStore Associate App release versions, see the
release notes
.
For an optimal experience with the app, we recommend upgrading to iOS 18.
Important
Currently, NewStore supports NewStore Associate App v.1.59.0 or later versions only on iOS 16 and later.
You cannot download or install this or later versions of the app on devices that are running on iOS 15 or earlier iOS versions
.
NewStore Omnichannel Manager - Browser compatibility
NewStore recommends using NewStore Omnichannel Manager on Google Chrome for an optimal user experience. If Google Chrome is not available, NewStore Omnichannel Manager can also be used on Safari or Firefox, but some features may not work as expected.
