NewStore supports booking international shipments from stores in your business, using the
EasyPost
adapter.
Important
Ensure that you handle the error paths as they can help NOM users understand what went wrong with an order that is on-Hold. See
Possible errors when retrieving or booking shipments
.
To enable booking international shipments:
Define the
product_hts_number
and
country_of_origin
fields when importing products that you want to ship internationally. See
Importing products
.
Update your fulfillment configuration to specify which countries you want to ship to, and specify the stores that can ship orders internationally. For more information, see the
tutorial
or the
API reference documentation
.
Assign a person in the store, whose name appears in the
commercial invoice
. This person is responsible for the accuracy of the information in the invoice and that it is ready for customs processing.
If required, configure the shipping provider to generate the
ITN
and submit electronic
commercial invoice
documents. Refer to the documentation for the related shipping provider.
Important
If the shipping provider submits the commercial invoice documents electronically to customs, NewStore does not include the commercial invoice as a document to print when shipping the order.
If the shipping provider does not submit the commercial invoice electronically, it is available to print in Omnichannel Manager: See
Monitoring orders
.
Add the shipping provider to EasyPost. See the
EasyPost guide
for the related shipping provider.
Configure the EasyPost adapter to book shipments with the related shipping providers. To configure the EasyPost adapter, contact the
support team
.
