The
Catalog
tab displays the following information:
Products and their stock levels across stores
The status of
import jobs
in your business
The products and product information such as the name, category, color, size and associated images displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager are imported from your Product Information Management system. The data displayed in the
Stock Levels
view is synced with your
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planner)
system.
To view products in a catalog, go to the
Products
tab and select a catalog from the
Catalog
drop-down list.
Note
By default, the products displayed on this page are from the default catalog specified for the retailer.
To search for products in a catalog, in the
Products
tab, select a catalog from the
Catalog
drop-down list and use the
Search
box.
Type the name of the product in the search box, and press Enter. If you know the size and color of the product, include this in your search. For example, type
Robin Sweater Black 6
. To sort the products in the search results by a column, click the column header. Each header you click is added to the current filter as filter criterion.
Technical Configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
Important
By default products can be searched by title, description, color, size, and caption but not by product IDs or
SKU
. If you want to be able to search for products using a specific identifier, add the field as a
searchable_attributes
in the head section of your product import JSON payload. For more information, see the
JSON schema for products
.
To see more details and images of the product, click the product name. All details available for the product are displayed, including external identifiers and extended attributes.
For example, click
Emily Sweater
to display available details like the Product ID and the images associated with it, its
price
,
category
, shipping dimension and weight.
External identifiers, such as
EAN
or
SKU
, are potentially used by third-party systems and hang tags in stores. Extended attributes, such as fit size, care instructions, and so on, meanwhile, are used to confirm that these attributes have been imported into the NewStore catalog from third-party systems.
Important
The price of products are retrieved from the default
price book
specified for the retailer, irrespective of the catalog you have selected in the
Products
tab.
The category imported as
is_main
during a product import is displayed against the relevant products in this tab. For more information, see the
guide
or the
tutorial
.
Viewing status of catalog imports
During data import into the NewStore platform, import jobs may fail or show errors. When such data
import issues
occur, it may result in missing catalog items in NewStore Associate App.
Such issues cannot be resolved by associates in the store. NewStore allows you to review these data import errors and issues in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, which can help you in investigating why these import jobs failed or cannot be completed.
To view the status of an import job and analyze import issues, go to
Catalog
>
Imports
.
On the
Catalog imports
page, you can:
Filter imports for a specific time period or the
import job status
.
Sort import jobs based on import IDs, names, entities, date received or completed, and statuses.
View details for a specific import job by clicking the
Import ID
.
In the import details page for a specific import job that has failed, resolve import issues by looking at the list of errors that caused the import to fail.
For example, the
Fulfillment Manager
can analyze the details of the following error and take corrective action:
Your integration does not accommodate sending multiple imports at the same time.This error can typically be avoided by submitting import requests with either Catalog Shop and Locale, or Availabilities Store ID.
In this error, the possible reason for import failure was starting too many imports at the same time.
