Business Impact & Priority Response Times
At our core, we're all about keeping your business running smoothly. We categorize support issues by
Business Impact
and
Priority
with clear
Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
for response time (keep in mind, this is our response time, not necessarily the resolution time). Here‚Äôs what each priority level means and how quickly you can expect to hear from us:
üö® S1 - Material GMV/Revenue Impact
What it Means
: Significant issues impacting Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) or essential revenue-driving operations, with no workaround available.
Response Time

1 hour
‚Äì Immediate action to get you back on track.
‚ö° S2 - Major Functionality Impact
What it Means
: Major functionality is disrupted, causing high operational impact and lacking a reasonable workaround.
Response Time
:
4 hours
‚Äì Quick response to restore your critical operations.
‚è≥ S3 - Non-Critical Functionality Impact
What it Means
: Partial service disruption with moderate-to-low impact; a workaround exists but may not be ideal.
Response Time
:
6 hours
‚Äì We‚Äôre on it to help maintain smooth operations.
üí° S4 - Low Impact or Question
What it Means
