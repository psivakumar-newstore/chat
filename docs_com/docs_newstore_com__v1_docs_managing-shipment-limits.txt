Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage shipment limits permission.
You can manage how many shipments can be used for an order in your business, via NewStore Omnichannel Manager. Using this feature helps you reduce shipping costs and ensure
shipping split orders
is not too expensive for your business.
Viewing shipment limits for orders
To view the existing limits on shipments that can be used to fulfill an order in your business, go to
Settings
>
Shipping
>
Shipping limits
.
The following columns are available:
Service level
: The
service level
for which the shipping limit has been defined.
Currency
: The currency in which the shipping costs have been defined.
Shipping limits per order
: The limits on shipments that can be used for each order. The number of shipments specified coincide with order value.
Creating limits for shipments for an order
To specify how many shipments can be used when fulfilling an order in your business:
Go to
Settings
>
Shipping
, and in the left menu, select
Shipment Limits
.
Click
Add Limit
.
Select the shipping
Service Level
and the
Currency
for this limit.
For example, you can specify
FEDEX_GROUND
as the
service level
, if applicable for your business. In currency, you can specify
USD
if you want to create this shipment limit for orders being fulfilled via fulfillment locations in the United States.
Note
Only the service levels specified in the fulfillment configuration for your business are available in this list.
Add a row to specify a new shipment limit, and specify the following:
Order value up to
: Specify an upper limit for the value of an order.
For example, you can specify an order limit of USD 100 by entering
100
.
Max. number of shipments
: Specify the maximum number of shipments that are allowed for orders that are within the relevant order value.
For example, specify
2
as the maximum number of shipments for orders that are within USD 100.
Repeat this step for each new shipment limit that you want to add and click
Save
.
Shipment limits are not applicable to orders above the highest order value specified for the shipment limits defined in your business.
For example, if you have defined shipment limits for all orders within
USD 100
,
no
shipment limits are applicable to orders above
USD 100
.
NewStore does not consider parts of an order that do not have shipment requirements (such as an
in-store pickup
) when applying shipment limits.
For example, if you have defined a maximum shipment limit of
2
, and your order has
8
items,
5
of which must be shipped in two split shipments, while the remaining
3
items are to be picked up in-store, the order is shipped as usual and no items go on hold.
