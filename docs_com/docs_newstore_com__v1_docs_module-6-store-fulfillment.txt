We are thrilled to announce our partnership with Dodici, the esteemed luxury fashion brand from Milan, Italy. As part of their strategic initiative to elevate customer satisfaction, their VP of Retail has outlined key requirements, including the integration of store inventory into e-commerce and enabling stores to fulfill home delivery orders. To meet these requirements, we will expertly configure the ship-from-store capability within the NewStore platform, delivering a seamless, customer-centric experience that upholds Dodici's exceptional luxury brand standards. This collaboration will undoubtedly enhance the shopping experience for Dodici's discerning customers while reinforcing our commitment to driving innovation in the retail industry.
Enabling ship-from-store allows retailers to utilize their store inventory to ship products directly to customers, offering numerous benefits. By leveraging store inventory, retailers can significantly reduce shipping time and cost, getting products to customers faster and increasing the likelihood of on-time delivery. This not only enhances the customer experience but also opens up more sales opportunities. With ship-from-store, retailers can offer a wider range of products, including those that may not be available in their warehouse or distribution center. Additionally, fulfilling orders from stores to customers nearby opens up the option to offer same-day delivery using a courier service. By enabling ship-from-stores, retailers can increase customer satisfaction, drive sales growth, and gain a competitive edge in the market.
