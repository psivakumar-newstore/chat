You can use an external bluetooth scanner to scan products, receipts, and coupons.
For more information on which Bluetooth barcode scanners are supported by NewStore, see
Supported hardware
.
Enabling Bluetooth scanning capabilities
Open the app and navigate to
Settings
>
Bluetooth Scanner
.
Enable the toggle to use external bluetooth scanner.
Important
A Bluetooth scanner needs to support
Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE)
mode to be discovered and connected to the app. Any other discovery mode is not supported by Associate App.
Also, ensure that your Associate App is authorized to use nearby Bluetooth devices. Verify this setting in your iOS device in
Settings > Associate > Bluetooth
.
If enabled for your business, associates are able to connect a Bluetooth Scanner to Associate App and use the Bluetooth Scanner
and
the camera of the device at the same time.
Connecting to a Bluetooth scanner
Open the application and navigate to
Settings
>
Bluetooth Discovery
.
Ensure that you set the
Bluetooth Scanner
into Discovery mode.
Start searching for a bluetooth scanner. When a device is detected, tap and select the device to connect to it.
Open a scanner.
Bluetooth Scanner
can be now used to scan any code.
Note
Bluetooth Scanner may shut itself down to save battery on the device.
When a Bluetooth Scanner is connected to the app, the same scanner can be used again on any scanning screen without having to rediscover and reconnect again.
The device camera on the
Cart
page cannot be used when the Bluetooth scanner is enabled in the settings.
