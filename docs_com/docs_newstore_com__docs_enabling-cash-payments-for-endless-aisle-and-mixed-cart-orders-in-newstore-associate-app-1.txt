Cash payments for
endless aisle
and
mixed cart
orders are disabled by default.
Important
When cash payments are enabled for endless aisle and mixed cart orders:
If an order is cancelled, the retailer must manually identify items paid with cash and refund the amount to the customer.
Cash payments for cancelled items are displayed as
Captured
in NOM
, instead of `Refunded`.
To enable cash payments for such orders, first ensure that Associate App sets the
fulfillment_group
property when creating carts.
To enable cash payments:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
