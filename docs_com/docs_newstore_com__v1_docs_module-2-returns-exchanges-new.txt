Dodici, a renowned luxury fashion brand from Milan, Italy, has partnered with us to ensure a seamless migration to NewStore. The VP of Retail has defined key requirements to enhance customer satisfaction, including:
Efficient processing of customer returns and refunds
Allowing customers to apply refund amounts to new purchases
Accepting returns without a sales order record
To meet these requirements, we will configure the returns and exchanges feature on the NewStore platform, delivering a seamless and customer-centric experience that aligns with Dodici's luxury brand standards.
Retailers typically allow customers to return or exchange items within a specified timeframe, commonly 30 days, as per their return policy. To initiate a return or exchange, customers can provide their details, and associates can look up the order using the Associate app or verify the sales or gift receipt from the original transaction. Exchanges enable customers to replace their purchase with an item of equal or lesser value or pay the difference for a higher-priced item.
NewStore offers flexible configuration options for processing refunds, including:
Refunds to the original payment method (with some restrictions)
Refunds to a new payment method (depending on the Retailer's policy)
Additionally, NewStore can be set up to manage inventory during the return process, categorizing items as:
Sellable
Damaged
Unsellable
This streamlined return and exchange process ensures a seamless customer experience while also enabling retailers to manage their inventory effectively.
