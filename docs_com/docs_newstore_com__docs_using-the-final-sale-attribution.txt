You can use extended attributes for products in NewStore Associate App to customize app behavior, such as the
final_sale
attribute.
The
final_sale
attribute allows products to be marked as items that cannot be returned by a customer. See the code sample for the attribute:
{
  "extended_attributes": [
    {
      "name": "final_sale",
      "value": "true"
    }
  ]
}
Displaying the badge in NewStore Associate App
If a product in an order has the
final_sale
attribute, a badge is displayed for the product in the
cart
,
purchase detail
,
return detail
and
return
screens in NewStore Associate App.
The
Final Sale
badge is an indicator that this product should not be returned, and the associate can inform the customer, if needed.
Important
Returning a product marked with the
Final Sale
badge is not blocked by the platform during the return process.
