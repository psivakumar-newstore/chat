With NewStore, you can create and customize all documents and customer notifications, to match the tone and brand for your business.
During the course of order placement, checkout, shipping, and processing, several events can trigger communication with your customers. With NewStore, you can configure two kinds of communication to be sent:
Documents
refer to customer communication that can be printed and emailed during checkout, when an order is placed and fulfilled. For example, an invoice or return receipt can be emailed or printed when an order is placed or returned, and a return label can be printed and packaged with an order, during fulfillment.
Notifications
are alerts that can be sent to customers via email or push notifications. For example, a notification can be sent to the customer when an order is canceled.
These documents and notifications are generated from templates. To learn how to customize them, See
Customizing templates
.
Types of documents
Printed documents and labels
During checkout, fulfillment, and shipping in NewStore, a number of documents and labels are printed via the NewStore platform. This includes invoice numbers or IDs generated during fulfillment or shipping, which are needed for purposes such as accounting and reconciliation of sales reports.
Documents printed during checkout
During checkout, store associates decide whether the following documents are printed or emailed via NewStore Associate App, based on the customer's preference. These documents can also be reprinted via NewStore Associate App. Unlike customer notifications and channels, no configuration is required for these documents.
Sales receipts
Exchange receipts
Return receipts
To generate the invoice ID and accounting address details in these financial documents via NewStore during checkout, set them up programmatically via an API in the platform. See
Configuring financial documents
.
Documents printed during fulfillment
During fulfillment, associates can print the documents to include in the package that is shipped to a customer. The type of documents that can be printed and the number of copies printed are configurable for your business in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud. For example, your business can be configured to print 2 invoices, 1 packing slip and 1 return form, but no return labels.
Note
For documents or labels to be printed in the store, ensure that the store is part of your order fulfillment process. For more information on how stores can be used for order fulfillment, See
Fulfillment configuration
.
For international shipments, you can print a
commercial invoice
from the shipping provider, if needed.
Labels are used during shipping, and most shipping providers use their own labels. These templates are not customizable via the
Templates
resource. However, if your provider doesn't give you labels, or you want to print labels for use during in-store checkouts, you can customize the label document templates in NewStore.
NewStore supports two types of printers that can be configured to print documents and labels. For example, a return form or an invoice can be printed using a document printer. Shipping labels, return labels, or in-store pickup labels can be printed using a label printer.
For a store or DC that does not have a label printer, labels can be printed using the document printer. To enable this feature, see
Configuring documents for print in a store or warehouse
.
During
store fulfillment
or inventory
transfer
s, PDF documents can also be printed in
A5
paper size if required. For example, when printing labels for the
Sagawa
shipping adapter in Japan.
Note
Ensure that the orientation of the paper is landscape when printing such labels.
Document and label printers print fulfillment documents in alphabetical order.
For help with configuring the documents you want to print during fulfillment,  see
Configuring documents for print in a store or warehouse
.
Email
Note
When designing HTML templates for email notifications, follow best practices to ensure that your formatting is rendered accurately.
You can customize the subject and the body of email messages, and update the email template to include images, your logo, and links to websites.
SMS
We support only one SMS template to alert customers when their order is ready for pickup in-store.
How communication is triggered
The events that can trigger communication to your customers, and the channel through which notifications are sent can also be configured. For help with this configuration, see the
Create order
method and the guide on
Configuring documents for print in a store or warehouse
.
The
jinja (*.j2)
files are templates that can be customized or updated to generate related notifications digitally or via printed documents.
For example, for emails to be sent to the customer for a successful refund, use or update the following templates:
refund_note
refund_note_email
refund_note_subject
For more information on updating templates via NewStore Omnichannel Manager for customer communication,  see
Managing templates
. You can also
programmatically update templates
via an API.
