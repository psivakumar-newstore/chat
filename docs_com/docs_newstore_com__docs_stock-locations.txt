Stock locations
Stock locations allow you to manage salable and unsalable inventory across your business.
Note
This feature is only available if you use NewStore as
inventory master
, instead of an ERP.
When you create a store for your business, it is also considered as a stock location that contains only salable items. The inventory receive, transfer, and adjustment processes modify the stock on hand in the source and destination locations.
You can create additional stock locations for non-salable inventory so that the stock on hand will change accordingly.
For example, you can create a stock location specifically for items to be displayed as visual merchandise in your store. They are not meant to be sold. The items in this stock location are not included in any store's stock on hand. You can include them into you stock on hand by transferring them to a store.
For a guide on how to create stock locations for your business, see
(Optional) Creating stock locations
.
Important
NewStore uses the main stock location by default for receiving inventory (with or without ASNs) and sales related operations. NewStore does not support receiving inventory into any other stock location. Selling items in the store deducts the inventory
only
in the main stock location.
To move inventory to another stock location,
adjust
inventory in your store.
