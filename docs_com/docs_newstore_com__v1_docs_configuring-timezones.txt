Use this configuration to set up a default timezone for your business. If needed, you can also enable the user's local timezone to be displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Configuring the default timezone
When you configure a default timezone for your business, it is used across all NewStore Omnichannel Manager interfaces, dashboards, and exported CSV files containing order data.
To configure a default timezone:
Use the
Update config
method for NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
In the
timezone
property, specify the timezone that your business needs to use.
Note
If no value is provided, EST is used as the configured timezone by default.
Enabling the user's local timezone
You can configure NewStore Omnichannel Manager to display the user's local timezone, based on their browser settings. Consider enabling this configuration if your business has users across multiple timezones. This allows them to view dates and times in their local timezone.
Note
Exported CSV files with order data and dashboards use the default timezone configured for your business. The default timezone is also used for filtering data on Omnichannel Manager.
To enable the user's local timezone:
Use the
Update config
method for NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
In the
userLocalTimezone
property, specify one of the following values:
Set
userLocalTimezone` to
true`` to change to the user's local timezone.
Set
userLocalTimezone` to
false`` to use the timezone configured for your business.
Note
If no value is provided, the timezone configured for your business is used by default.
