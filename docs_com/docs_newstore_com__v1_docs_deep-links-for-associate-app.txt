Deep links for Associate App allow linking back from customization webviews to the Associate App. Depending on the type of web application, this can enabled use cases like product recommendations, wishlist and others.
Using a deep link to open a product modal
This deep link triggers a product card for a specific product. The card is dismissible and allows the user to either navigate to the product detail screen or add it to the cart directly.
Example how to use the deep link in a webview:
<ul>
   <li><a href="com.newstore.associate-one://products/preview?productId=1000501">Product 1000501</a></li>
   <li><a href="com.newstore.associate-one://products/preview?productId=1000702">Product 1000702</a></li>
</ul>
