In some scenarios, you may want to continue using a legacy order management system (OMS) for primary order fulfillment tasks, and configure NewStore as the secondary OMS for your business.
For more information on using an external OMS to fulfill orders in your business, see
Using an external OMS to fulfill orders
.
To retrieve the external OMS configuration set up for your business, use the
Get external OMS config
method.
To enable or disable an external OMS for your business, use the
Enable external OMS config
method, and set the
enabled
property to
true
.
Configuring ATP via an external OMS
In some scenarios you may want to continue using a legacy
external OMS
to fulfill orders in your business, and use NewStore as the secondary OMS. In such cases, NewStore uses the
Availability webhook
to retrieve information on product ATP from the external OMS. NewStore does not maintain the ATP of products for your business in such cases.
To retrieve the webhook config for ATP information, use the
Get webhook config
method.
To update the webhook config to retrieve ATP information for products, use the
Update webhook config
method:
In the
url
property, specify the URL that will be called via the webhook by NewStore.
In the
api_key
property, specify the API key to be used for authenticating the requests.
In the
external_identifier
property, specify the type of product identifier that the integration will check for when retrieving ATP information.
Note
Currently, you can only specify
product_id
as the external identifier for products.
In the
timeout
property, specify the timeout limit in seconds for the request.
After the webhook config has been set, use the
Enable config to request external ATP data
method and set
value
to
true
to start requesting ATP data from the external OMS. To retrieve the current configuration for your business, use the
Get config to request external ATP data
method.
Note
If this configuration is disabled, NewStore uses the value for
stock
within the platform as ATP for products.
If you decide to stop using an external OMS to fulfill orders, and want to use NewStore to manage order fulfillment in your business, use the
Delete webhook config
method to delete the webhook configuration.
Note
Ensure that NewStore maintains ATP for products in your business when you stop using an external OMS, and start using NewStore for order fulfillment tasks. See
About order fulfillment
.
Displaying external OMS orders in NewStore Associate App
To display external OMS orders and purchase history for external OMS orders in NewStore Associate App:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
Set
use_new_om_ui
to
true
.
