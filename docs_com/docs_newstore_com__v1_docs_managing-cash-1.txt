Daily open, daily close, and intra-day audit for a cash drawer
You can use Associate App to
activate
and
deactivate
a cash drawer, and to perform an intra-day audit. Cash transactions to a specific drawer require the drawer to be activated.

Daily Open
,
Daily Close
, and
Audit Count
procedures.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
You can configure whether the app shows the expected amount in
Daily Close
and
Audit Count
. For details, see
Displaying the expected amount for cash counting
.

Using the Cash Denomination Calculator
Retailers have the option of using the cash denomination calculator or using the total amount entry when performing the Daily Open, Daily Close, and Audit Count tasks. When using the cash denomination calculator, users count the quantity of various currency bills or coins and enter those values into the calculator - which then populates the specific task currency total, which is then used to complete the task. When using the Total Amount option, users simply enter the total currency amount field, which is then used to complete the task.
Retailers can choose between using the cash denomination calculator or the total amount entry when performing the Daily Open, Daily Close, and Audit Count tasks. When using the cash denomination calculator, users count the quantity of various bills or coins and enter the values into the calculator. The calculator then populates the task’s currency total, which is used to complete the task. Alternatively, when using the Total Amount option, users simply enter the total currency amount, which is then used to complete the task.
Note
The currencies used by the denomination calculator are tied to the store’s specific currency, as configured within the NewStore platform. Only one currency is supported per store.
To use the denomination calculator:
Access the
Cash Management
option from the
…More
menu on the Associate App.
Select the task you want like to perform: Daily Open, Daily Close, or Audit Count.
Select
Cash Breakdown
at the top of the screen.
Enter the quantity of the number of bills or coins that correspond to the options shown on the screen.
After counting the currency quantities, tap
Proceed
to submit the currency value total to the task being performed.
Note
If your store is configured to alert users to a variance, they can choose to recount the currency amounts. Selecting Recount will return the user to the Cash Breakdown section if that is where the total was submitted. If using the Total Amount view instead of the Cash Breakdown, the user will be returned to that view when choosing to recount.
