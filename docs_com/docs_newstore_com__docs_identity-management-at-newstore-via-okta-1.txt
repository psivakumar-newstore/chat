Pre-requisites
To set up an identity management application to manage authentication for NewStore apps, ensure that you have access to:
Omnichannel Manager
Okta admin console
Important
To enable users from your corporate directory to be able to use the NewStore applications, you have to create users, assign them to a store, and assign relevant roles in NewStore.
Setting up Okta with NewStore
This process involves working with Okta and Omnichannel Manager in tandem. Ensure you have access to both before you proceed.
Log into your Okta admin console and go to
Applications

area, select
OIDC - OpenID Connect

Application type
area, select
Web Application
.
Click
Next
.
In the
New Web App Integration
screen that appears:
In
App integration name
, enter either
NewStore Staging
or
NewStore Production
, based on the NewStore environment for which you are setting up the integration.
In
Sign-in redirect URIs
, keep the default entry for now
In
Controlled access
, select
Skip group assignment
.
Note
If you know which of your Okta groups should gain access to NewStore, configure them via
Limit access to selected groups
.
Click
Save
.
