Omnichannel Insights is an advanced analytics capability that enables retail brands to see a global view of their most important omnichannel metrics. With data available via the web-based Omnichannel Manager and iOS-based Associate App, we equip both HQ and store teams with the tools they need to make strategic decisions for their business.
What can Omnichannel Insights assist with?
In-store performance for associates
- Retail headquarter teams can easily configure and enable the Sales Dashboard in NOM under the Insights menu. After setup, the Sales Dashboard can be found under
More
>
Sales Dashboard
in Associate App.
Daily sales floor replenishment
- Store Managers can leverage the “Replenishment” out of the box report to track items that have left the shelves in a given day.
Measure overall omnichannel impact
- Retail and Operations teams can use the “Omnichannel” out of the box dashboard to understand how shoppers are interacting with their brand across channels.
Understand consumer buying behavior
- Headquarters can understand details around shopper behavior using the “Customer“ out of the box dashboard to understand things like most valuable shoppers, and repeat buyer metrics vs anonymous buyer metrics.
Enhance operational efficiency
- Headquarters can leverage out of the box templates to evaluate things like Fulfillment Fill Rates by location, to understand why a given location may be rejecting more fulfillment requests than others and help enable that location for success.
Provide timely updates to key stakeholders
- Users in retail Headquarters can leverage NOM Explore to schedule Liveboards to be emailed on a schedule to keep stakeholders informed of business critical “Key Performance Indicators”.
Financial reconciliation
- Finance teams can use the NOM out of the box Payments report to export and reconcile NewStore data against other systems.
What does the Omnichannel Insights feature set include?
Associate App Sales Dashboard, which is configured in NOM and is displayed in Associate App for associates on the sales floor.
NOM
Reports
, for users who require more interaction with metrics, such as exporting data, drilling down into a data point to investigate further, or applying additional filters such as looking at different time periods
Explore
, for users who require a full business intelligence tool to enable a fully customizable dashboard that can be shared across the organization via NOM
Reports
.
The liveboards under Omnichannel Insights are powered by ThoughtSpot. For additional documentation on the usability of Thoughtspot, see the
ThoughtSpot User Guide
.
Viewing reports to interact with metrics and learn more
The
Reports
menu gives store and regional managers the ability to see a feature reduced version of what is available in
Insights
>
Explore
. This menu item is designed to provide a list of up to 100 liveboards that are shared with the user and remove all other distractions. This allows data creators to provide pre-determined set of liveboards with a given data consumer.
Investigating data anomalies with data drill down
Right click any data point on any widget and select another dimension to refresh that widget with. For example, if you want to investigate a week with higher than normal orders, you can right click the week, select
Drill Down
in the menu, and filter on the
Channel Type
to see the percentage of orders coming from web vs store.
Filtering a liveboard
Reduce the data set for the entire liveboard by selecting a specific store, or order dates. When you select a filter at the top of the liveboard, a modal window appears allowing the choice of including or excluding specific values in the entire liveboard.
Note
Select
Add filters
in bulk on the filters modal window and paste values to avoid waiting for the filters to appear. The values can be comma, newline, or semicolon separated.
Users can right-click a data point and filter a liveboard using that value. For example, right-click an associate name and select
Filter
to refresh the entire liveboard and filter the data with the specified associate.
For more information, see
ThoughtSpot User Guide
.
Note
Filters are not saved if you navigate away from a chart. Select
Save View
on the top-left of the chart saves the filters you have chosen for later. When the dashboard is refreshed, it will default to the last
Saved View
that was selected.
Explore feature for users who require a complete Business Intelligence experience
The NewStore Omnichannel Insights platform enables retail brands to grow their direct-to-consumer store business through physical stores and direct digital channels. During the course of business, NewStore's multi-tenant SaaS platform collects large amounts of omnichannel data and can now provide that data back to retailers in a consolidated, actionable, and flexible way allowing retailers to make strategic business decisions.
NewStore Omnichannel Insights aspires to be a platform that is the source of truth for:
Physical and digital sales & returns data
Store & associate performance data
Omnichannel consumer behavior data
Payment & Taxes data
Order fulfillment data across stores
Insights is available in multiple environments, such as
Staging
and
Production
.
Migrating a liveboard or answer to Production
You can create a new liveboard or answer in
Staging
to have a tighter control over the data, and then migrate the liveboard/answer over to your
Production
environment.
Follow these steps:
Navigate to the environment you want to migrate liveboards or answer from and expand
Insights
>
Liveboards
or
Answers
(whichever you wish to migrate).
Select the checkboxes next to the items you want to export and select
Export TML
at the top of the table.
A file is downloaded to your local hard drive of either a single TML file or a ZIP file containing multiple TML files.
Navigate to the environment you want to migrate liveboards into and expand
Insights
>
Liveboards
or
Answers
(whichever you exported).
Create a new
Liveboard
or
Answer
and click
:
in the top right corner.
Select
TML
>
Edit
and open the TML file you wish to import in a text editor (preferably NotePad, or TextEdit).
Copy the entire contents of one of the TML files you wish to import except the first line, and paste the contents of the TML file.
Note
Leave the first line that starts with
guid:
and paste the contents right after.
Click
Publish
.
The liveboard or answer is now migrated and available in the new environment.
Getting started
See the high-level steps below to get started.
The getting started guide assumes a sales dashboard is being created for store managers. However, any of the out of the box dashboards can be used. View
Out-of-the-box dashboards available for Insights
for more details about what dashboards are available, and which customizations are recommended (if any).
Identify user data needs.
Make a copy of the appropriate template. In this example, use the
Template - Daily Sales
default liveboard and adjust it to your own needs.
Exclude non-merch SKUs from consideration.
Save and share your new liveboard.
Pre-requisites
There are many ways to roll out reporting with
Insights
and it depends on who you would like to have access to which functionality, and which data.
The questions that are worth answering are:
Who will create and customize the initial set of dashboards that are then shared with the rest of the business?
Which groups of users (Regional managers, Associates, Store Ops, HQ staff, and so on) can view the
Reports
and
Explore
menu items.
To understand what roles are available to you:
Roles with the
View Insights
permission will see the default
Reports
menu item in Omnichannel Manager and will only see a list of liveboards that are shared with them without many of the features available in Explore. Users with View Insights permissions will have access to all tenant data.
Roles with
Create Insights
permission will see everything with the
View Insights
permission and will see the
Explore
parent menu item in Omnichannel Manager. These roles will also have full access to the BI tool, including access to all available fields and data, and the ability to create new dashboards.
Using and adjusting the template to your needs
To leverage the template to your needs:
Go to
Insights
>
Explore
>
Liveboards
.
Select the template
Template - Daily Sales
.
Click
...
in the top right corner and select
Make a copy
.
Edit
Title
and
Description
, which will be visible to your users.
Showing pre-configured liveboards to users
If you would like to give Store and Regional managers a pre-defined set of dashboards to look at, we recommend giving them access to the
Insights > Reports
view. This method will provide them with access to your entire dataset with a limited feature set so that they are not overwhelmed by too many features and options available in Explore and can focus on selling.
For more information, see
Defining and delivering a controlled view of data for specific users
.
Excluding non-merch SKUs
When you have the copy of your new liveboard, perform the following steps:
Select
Edit
in the top right corner of your liveboard.
Note
After you copy a default liveboard, you will then be able to edit it. Alternatively, you must have permissions to edit a liveboard shared with you.
Select the
Sale Product SKU
filter at the top corner of the liveboard.
Click the
Exclude
link to exclude your non-merch SKUs.
Select
Add values in bulk
on the modal window that appears.
Paste the SKUs that you want to exclude from the
Template - Daily Sales
. For example, bag fees, tailoring, gift cards, and other non-merch items that you do not want to include towards your sales.
Select
Apply
.
When the modal window disappears, click
Save
on the liveboard.
When anyone reviews this liveboard, these SKUs will automatically be excluded from any of the widgets on the liveboard.
Saving and sharing your new liveboard
When you have the copy of your new liveboard, perform the following steps:
Select
Share
.
Clear the
Send Notification
checkbox. NewStore does not send email notifications to users.
If you want to share your liveboard with all, you can make it appear in their liveboard list by searching for your tenant name and adding that
Group
to your liveboard.
Note
Your tenant name is in the address bar. For example, if you access NewStore Omnichannel Manager from “manager.dodici-demo.p.newstore.net”, your group name in
Explore
will be something like “dodici-demo - All Users”.
If you want to only add individual users to be able to view or edit your liveboard, type their email address in the search.
Note
If you can't find someone, they may not have logged into Omnichannel Manager yet. NewStore creates usernames as users view
Insights > Reports
, or
Insights > Explore
.
If you want users or groups to be able to view and/or edit, select the
Can View
, and/or
Can Edit
options.
Click
Save
on your liveboard.
Emailing a Liveboard
Insights offers the ability to share a Liveboard that has been created. This can be done by entering the email address that should receive the liveboard in the scheduler. In order to schedule an Answer, first pin the Answer to a Liveboard, and then schedule that Liveboard.
Navigate to a Liveboard you want to share
Click the three-dot menu in the top right corner
Select
Manage Schedules
Select
Create Schedule
Provide a Name, Description, Frequency, and Type (format) to receive the liveboard in.
Note
Use CSV or XLS for single tables of data. If a liveboard has many widgets, this type of report is not compatible
Enter the recipients email address
Note
If entering individual email addresses, do not use the email provided with the account which is prefixed with the tenant name (e.g. using tenant-user@mail.com).
Incorrect:
tenant-user@mail.com
Correct:
user@mail.com
Save the schedule
Use case: BORIS Uplift liveboards
BOPIS (Buy Online, Pick-Up In Store) Uplift tracks additional purchases made by customers on the same day they pick up their online orders in-store. While BOPIS order data has been available before, this feature includes in-store uplift sales, offering a complete picture of customer behavior.
Viewing BORIS Uplift data
The BOPIS Uplift metric is available in Omnichannel Insights in NOM. The column tracks same-day uplift sales, offering visibility into in-store shopping behavior.
The
Sale is BOPIS Uplift
must be set as equal to true when an original order fulfillment service level is set to
pick_up_in_store
and the same customer makes an in-store purchase on the same calendar day.
Example scenario
Place order online to pick up in store -
April 1
Pick up item in the store, which was ordered online -
April 3
This picked up item will be marked as
Sale is BOPIS Uplift
=
false
because it is the original item purchased online.
Purchase additional item in-store - April 3
This additional item will be marked as
Sale is BOPIS Uplift
=
true
because this is an uplift, or up-sell, which the associate was able to make when the customer was picking up their online order.
Adopting BORIS Uplift
Use the
Template - Omnichannel
dashboard in NOM >
Insights > Explore > Liveboards
as-is with the new chart and enjoy the additional visibility it provides around BOPIS Uplift
To pin the new widget from the
Template - Omnichannel
liveboard, click
…
on the widget for the liveboard, select
pin
, and pin it to an existing dashboard.
Insights > Explore > Search
and using the filter
Sale is BOPIS Uplift
=
true
in the search bar:
Copy and paste the following information into
NOM > Insights > Explore > Search
to see the number of orders and value of orders which have benefited from a BOPIS interaction:
Sale Is BOPIS Uplift = true
unique count Order
Activity Date = last week
Sale Price Net
Activity Type = item
Sale Item Type = product
Troubleshooting unexpected widget values
The following two methods help you understand the values behind a specific widget:
Look at the raw data behind a number:
Right click any data point or any widget menu and select
Show Underlying Data
to view the rows of data that are making up that number. This allows you to see, for example, which orders are making up the order count total.
View how the number was created:
If the underlying data shows unexpected results, select the widget menu on the liveboard and make a copy or edit. If the
Make a copy
option was chosen, this copy will have all of the filters applied, and potentially any formulas used to create the metric. It shows the exact details of how the metric was created, and re-pinning of a modified metric back to the liveboard, if required. If the
Edit
option was chosen, saving any changes will automatically update the existing widget on the liveboard.
Defining and delivering a controlled view of data for specific users
Sometimes it might be important to share a specific set of pre-filtered data along with pre-determined widgets to a given user. For instance, a recurring report to store managers showing their performance. This can be achieved by giving that user the
View Insights
permission in their role, and sharing the liveboard as
View Only
with them.
In this scenario, let's take an existing
Template - Daily Sales
dashboard and make it a regional dashboard for your region manager to view it each Monday morning.
Create your liveboard
: Navigate to
Explore
, select the
Template - Daily Sales
default dashboard, click
...
in the top right corner and
Make a copy
of this liveboard.
Modify the liveboard
: Once you’ve saved your liveboard, edit it and modify the filters to include the store names that are in the region you wanted. You may also be able to filter the liveboard by order currency as a shortcut.
Share the liveboard:
Now that you have a custom liveboard for a given region, share it with the users (with the email address or name) you want to view the liveboard.
Change user permissions
: Ensure that the users you want to view the liveboards have the
View Insights
permission enabled for their role. This can be modified by an admin in Omnichannel Manager, in
Settings
>
Users & Roles
>
Roles
.
Last Data Refresh in Minutes
The
Template - Daily Sales
liveboard contains a
Last Data Refresh in Minutes
widget. It displays how many minutes have passed since the data was last refreshed.
This means, if an order occurred 15 minutes ago and the last refresh was 12 minutes ago, then the order should be displayed in the report. If there is no data in the report (e.g. when selecting a store or associate who has no sales), it will display
{null}
.
The data can not be manually refreshed, it will automatically refresh.
Historical extent of reporting
Omnichannel Insights reporting spans a rolling 15-month window.
This means the last 4 quarters of data are available for analysis, which applies to all dashboards and all datasets, including 'Activities' and 'Clienteling Sales'.
Note
To see reports beyond 15 months, reach out to your Omnichannel Success Manager. The OSM will create a ticket for NewStore Engineering to extract the required data from the database.
Out-of-the-box dashboards available for Omnichannel Insights
While the reporting in NewStore provides as much flexibility as you would like, this can be challenging when starting with a blank dashboard for reports. To launch dashboards in minutes, you can use multiple templates available in NOM, or use them with minimal customizations.
If there are a lot of liveboards already created or assigned to you, the templates may be hard to find. To only view the out-of-the-box dashboards listed in NOM, in
Insights
>
Explore
>
Liveboards
from the
Tags
menu, select
Default Dashboards
.
You can also learn about the
NewStore data model
by copying a certain metric or dashboard and verify which fields, filters, or formulas were used to create a dashboard, such as the how the

Returns
No
The

dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into store-based return activity.
Understand the relation between seasonality and returns.
Some templates are defaulted to USD, such as the
Store & Associate Performance
dashboard. If a value of sales is reported in original currency (the default in dashboards unless specified otherwise), you can summarize those currencies into a single HQ currency to view performance across different currencies.
You can change currencies by adding the 3-digit currency ID after the field name. For example,
Sale Price Net
can be modified to
Sale Price Net AUD
or
Sale Price Net USD
can be modified to
Sale Price Net CAD
.
To change the currency:
Navigate to the liveboard or answer that you want to modify.
Edit the widget by clicking the
…
menu in the top right of the chart or table.
In the search bar that contains all the properties, filters, and measures, change the field to include the converted currency.
These currencies are currently supported: AUD, USD, CAD, EUR, GBP.
These fields can be converted:
Sale Price Net
,
Sale Price Tax
,
Activity Value
,
Shipment Price Net
, and
Return Refund Net
.
Currencies are extracted daily as a daily market average, after markets close. Viewing a converted currency for
Today
results in using yesterday's currency at close until close of the current business day occurs. This means the value of converted currency values will change slightly after market closes. Any converted value after
Today
does not change.
Setting up the NewStore Associate App Sales Dashboard for stores
