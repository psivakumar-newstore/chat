Improvements
üí™
Cart - Dynamic text sizes for accessibility
Enhanced text resizing in the
Cart
view by improving the responsiveness of various UI elements. This is a step forward towards
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
readiness.
Single-choice filters
Added support for single-choice filters (
equality search
). Now, brands can offer more granular filtering to their user, such as a price discount percentage filter. For example, up to 10%, up to 30%,
or
up to 50%.
Custom app icons
With
iOS 18, users can customize the appearance of their app icons
to be light, dark, or tinted. Since branding is essential in fashion, retailers can create their own icon variations to ensure each one aligns with their brand. To know more, see
Apple Human Interface Guidelines
.
To add your custom app icons, contact your Omnichannel Success Manager and provide the new icons based on the icon template from
Apple Design Resources
.
Peak time reliability with autoscaling
Improved autoscaling across various backend services to ensure further platform reliability and resilience during peak time. Now, you can direct traffic to your Shopping App even more confidently.
Bug fixes üêû
Favorites Synchronization and Remember Last Size
Fixed an issue where using
Favorite Synchronization
together with
Remember Last Size
feature caused the wrong product configuration to load when opening a product from the
Favorites
list.
Release v3.47.0
Release date: March 10, 2025
We're excited to announce a new version of iOS core v3.37.0. This release includes adaptations for accessibility, a new Quick Action Button, SAP Emarsys Custom Events support, and various technical improvements.
New features
üéâ
Dynamic text sizes for accessibility
The iOS app supports dynamic text sizes. Users can now adjust text sizes via system settings for a more inclusive experience. This enhancement aligns with the
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
requirements. The act ensures that digital products and services, including e-commerce apps, are accessible to people with disabilities or impairments.
Early Access: Quick Action Button
The
Quick Action Button
allows brands to highlight one essential feature to their Shopping App users, for example, a live chat, loyalty program dashboard, or support hub. Customers can instantly access the key app screen using this button from anywhere in the Shopping App.
This is a floating button that can be dragged up and down, and snapped on the left or right edge. It always remains visible and allows seamless navigation to a defined view or App Extension in the app. The button is configurable by country and language and can be enabled without requiring a new app update.
This feature is in Early Access. Contact your Omnichannel Success Manager to have this enabled.
Improvements
üí™
SAP Emarsys Custom Events
Added support for Custom Events in our Emarsys integration. Brands can now easily segment guest users based on their app interactions and target them with more relevant personalized push notifications.
UI elements labels for screen-reader accessibility
Added descriptive labels to the user interface elements to improve screen-reader accessibility. Labels make it easier for visually impaired users to navigate and use the app with a screen-reader. This is a step forward towards
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
readiness.
UI elements touch target for accessibility
Adjusted the touch areas of user interface elements to improve interaction accessibility. Larger touch targets make it easier for motion impaired users to navigate the app reducing mistaps. This is a step forward towards
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
readiness.
Updated minimum iOS version
Updated the minimum operative system version of our apps to iOS 17. With the vast majority of the user base on the lastest iOS version, reducing backward compability ensures more stability and reliability.
