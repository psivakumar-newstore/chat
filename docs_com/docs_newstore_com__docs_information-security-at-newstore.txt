NewStore aligns with multiple Information Security compliance standards. NewStore’s Security and Privacy team has established these policies and controls, to monitor compliance with these controls, as a means of providing compelling evidence of our security and compliance to third-party auditors.
NewStore Information Security policies are based on the following principles:
Access Requirements
Access is limited to businesses or individuals that have a genuine or legitimate need, with access granted on the basis of least privilege.
Security Controls
Security controls are implemented and stacked based on the principle of defense in depth. Security controls are applied consistently, and across all enterprise areas.
Implementation
Implementation of security control is iterative, maturing continuously and becoming effective, easy to audit, and less ground for friction with time.
To view all the resources and controls related to Information Security at NewStore, visit the NewStore Trust Center.
