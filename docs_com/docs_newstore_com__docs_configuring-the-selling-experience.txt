Overview
Retailers can configure the default settings of NewStore Associate App to suit specific operational needs through the various configurations available within the app. These configurations improve workflows and enhance store operations. You can configure approvals, inventory management, customer profiles, store operations, payments, loyalty programs, and more, which enhance the customer experience. For example, you can configure the time zone for your stores, set grace periods, configure the return process and more.
Additionally, you can configure the app to manage tasks like carton-level receiving, loyalty rewards, cash management, and endless aisle. You can automate key processes, reduce errors, and ensure smoother operations, from transaction handling to customer service.
Customers benefit from quicker, more accurate service at checkout and personalized experiences. Configuring features like address completion and auto-populated profiles help associates serve customers faster, improving overall satisfaction.
You can also configure the app for individual store associates by setting specific permissions and roles for each user, and ensure appropriate access tailored to their responsibilities. For more information, see
