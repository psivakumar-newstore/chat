Add
distribution centers
(DC) and configure contact information to be able to route orders, calculate taxes, and generate invoices and return labels.
Important
When
stock
is
imported
with
store_id
as
null
, the DC specified as the location of the stock is automatically created as a
fulfillment_node_id
in NewStore. Ensure that you know the
fulfillment_node_id
of the DC before you make any updates to the configuration.
NewStore can only be the
inventory master
for stores in your business, and not DCs.
Configuring DCs
To configure DCs created during a stock import, use the
Update DC configuration
API. When configuring the DC, in:
url
, specify the URL for the fulfillment provider at the DC. This is where fulfillment requests for orders will be posted.
api_key
, specify the
api_key
that authenticates calls to the URL.
To retrieve the existing configuration of a DC, use the
Get DC configuration
API.
Note
If the configuration for a DC or store was not working correctly, the integrations needs to be fixed just once. The platform automatically re-sends any fulfillment requests that were unsuccessful before due to the wrong configuration, once a day.
To update the address and contact details of a DC that you have set up for your business, use the
Update DC location
API.
Note
You cannot specify the operational business hours or the applicable timezone for a DC.
You can now add the DC to the
fulfillment configuration
to be able to route orders to it.
Enabling or disabling DCs
You can also use an API to enable or disable a DC to manage order fulfillment in your business.
To enable a DC that has been set up for your business, but is not active yet, use the
Enable location
API.
To disable a DC that is already being used to fulfill orders in your business, use the
Disable location
API.
