We are excited to announce our partnership with Dodici, a prestigious luxury fashion brand from Milan, Italy. To enhance customer satisfaction and drive sales, Dodici's VP of Retail has defined key objectives:
Manage store inventory
using NewStore.
Support virtual locations
(sellable and non-sellable).
Enable inventory adjustments
to maintain accuracy.
Facilitate cycle counts and full inventory counts
for precise stock tracking.
Streamline store transfers
with and without carrier shipping labels.
Allow associates to receive shipments
from other stores and distribution centers (DCs).
Enable blind receiving
for improved efficiency.
To achieve these objectives, we will configure NewStore’s store inventory management features to ensure accurate inventory tracking, providing a seamless customer experience and optimizing sales.
Success Criteria
The success criteria for this initiative are clear. Upon completion, store associates will have the necessary skills and knowledge to:
Perform inventory adjustments accurately.
Complete cycle counts and full inventory counts.
Initiate store transfers efficiently.
Receive Advance Ship Notices (ASNs) without errors.
By implementing these enhancements, Dodici can maintain precise inventory control, support omnichannel operations, and elevate the overall shopping experience.
