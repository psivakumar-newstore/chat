Editing shipping information in the grace period
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Edit shipping permission.
Note
Working on an
On Hold
order? See
Fixing a Shipping Address Error
.
If configured for your business, you can edit shipping information for an order only
during the grace period
. At this point, the order is still
Pending
and is not being routed to a fulfillment location. The
Activity
displayed when you click the item status shows if the item is already being routed.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable shipping info updates, see
Enabling updates to shipping info
.
To give you enough time to update the shipping information for the order, the grace period configured for your business is extended for 15 minutes, each time you click
Edit Shipping Info
.
On the
Sales
>
Orders
page, click the order ID for which you want to update shipping information and click
Edit Shipping Info
.
To edit the shipping address:
Click
Edit
in the
Shipping address
section.
On the
Edit Shipping Address
page, enter the new address or choose a suggested address option displayed to you, to fill in the address and ZIP code automatically. The shipping provider may not be able to offer the original
shipping option
for the changed address.
To choose a shipping option for the address you updated, click the
Shipping Option
button on the
Edit Shipping Address
page.
To only update the shipping option:
Click
Edit
in the
Shipping option
section.
Choose a new shipping option. The cost displayed against each option is only to help you make an informed decision for the order. The difference in the shipping costs is not charged to the customer.
Note
You can only choose one shipping option for the order even if delivery for items in the order is split.
Click
Overview
to review the updates you made to the shipping address and shipping option.
Enter any additional information that might be helpful. For example, the reason the customer requested the change.
Click
Submit
.
The invoice shipped with the order is updated but the sales receipt for the order will contain the address specified when the order was placed. The changed address is added to the customer's profile. The
Timeline
displays the original address and shipping option and the order details in the left pane displays the changed address and shipping option.
Swapping products in the grace period
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Swap product permission.note
Note
Working on an
On Hold
order? See
Managing On Hold orders with insufficient inventory
.
When a
customer requests a swap
, you can make this change only if the order is in the grace period, and the order is not already being routed. The order status is
Pending
.
You cannot add or remove products from an order during the swap. Enabling users to swap products in an order is a business decision. To enable this feature for your business, contact the
support team
.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable swap, see
Enabling swaps during grace period
.
You can swap a product for any other available product without restrictions. However, if the new product in the swap:
costs more than the original product, your business absorbs the cost.
costs less than the original product, the customer absorbs the cost.
To swap a product in an order:
On the Order details page, place your cursor near the price of the product.
Click
Swap product
. The
Swap product
button is not displayed if the order has already been routed.
In the
Swap product
view, type the new SKU for the product that you want to swap with the original product. To check if there is enough stock for the product, see
Monitoring stock levels
.
Choose the reason for the swap.
To see the activity for the product, on the Order details page, click
Pending
. The swap activity, the swapped product SKUs, and the swap reason are displayed. If you swap a product multiple times, the activity displays all the swaps and the associated reasons.
The
Payment
section for the order displays payment information for the original product in the order and does not display the recalculated price for the swapped product. For example, if the original product for USD 50 was swapped for a product that costs USD 75, the price and payment information still displays USD 50. However, customer notifications, the invoice and other financial documents reflect the updated order with the swapped product.
Refunding orders or items in an order
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Issue refunds permission.
You can partially or completely refund orders or items in an order. For example, you can issue a refund for a returned item or offer an
appeasement
for an item that is damaged, to a customer.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable refunds or appeasements for individual items in an order, see
Enabling order item refunds
.
Important
For countries where
fiscal regulations
apply, NewStore does not support appeasement refunds that are part of in-store orders.
For
offline orders
, refunds can only be made via cash or gift cards.
When you have enabled the feature to
refund individual items within an order
, the new
Refund
screen appears in NOM.
However, when the feature is disabled, or for orders where a refund, appeasement, or return was started for the customer before the feature was enabled, you will still see the old
Refund
screen in NOM.
To refund a customer:
Go to the
Sales
tab and open a completed order.
Click
Refund
.
In the
Refund Items
window, select the item(s) that you want to process refunds for.
Note
Select all the items to refund the whole order.
You can specify a fixed amount to refund to the customer or specify a percentage value to calculate the refund amount as a percentage of the total value of the item(s).
Note
If you have selected all of the items in the order, the percentage value for the refund is applied to all items in the order.
If needed, you can also select and refund the shipping costs for the order as an appeasement for the customer.
To specify a fixed amount refund to appease the customer, select
Exact value
and specify the amount you want to refund to the customer.
If you have selected more than 1 item to appease, the amount is prorated and distributed across the price of the items.
For example, if you chose to provide an appeasement of $50 on 2 items in an order (a $10 bag and a $100 shirt), NewStore applies a $5 appeasement on the bag and a $45 appeasement on the shirt.
To specify a percentage amount of the value of the item(s), select
Percentage
and specify the percentage value you want to refund to the customer.
If you have selected more than 1 item to appease, the percentage amount is applied to all the items.
NewStore does not recalculate or change taxes levied on an order when performing refunds to appease customers.
Select a reason for the refund.
(Optional) Add notes to explain the reason for the refund.
(Optional) Enter the email of the customer.
After the refund is successfully processed, the customer is notified by email.
Click
Refund
. The refund is processed using the payment strategy configured based on the refund policy for your business in NewStore. For example, your payment strategy might be set to allow refunds to the original payment method first and to other credit cards or to a gift card.
For offline orders, there is no reference to the original payment method in NewStore. You can only issue cash or a gift card to refund the customer, even if the order was paid for via credit card.
After the refund is processed by the payment service provider, the payment status and details for both refunds for returns and for appeasements are displayed in the
Payments
section. See
Payment status
.
Important
The status of refund or appeasements completed for individual items in an order are displayed in the
Refund Payments
window when you want to refund other items in the same order.
For example, if there are 2 items in an order, and you process a 100% refund for the first item, the first item is disabled for refund when you start the refund process for the second item in the order.
Details of refunds for returns are displayed in the
Timeline
on the order details page,
and
in the
Activity
when you click the item status. However, details of appeasements are only displayed in the
Timeline
on the order details page.
Note
Sometimes an appeasement might be approved before the payment is captured for the order. For example, when the product has not been shipped yet and an appeasement has been issued. Check the order
Timeline
. The appeasement refund is displayed as
Pending
until sufficient payment has been captured for the order. When subsequent appeasements are requested for the order, the
Pending
appeasements are included in the
Previously refunded
total.
