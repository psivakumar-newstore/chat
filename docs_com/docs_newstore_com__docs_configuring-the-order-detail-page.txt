Extended order attributes
You can configure the order detail page to show the extended attributes of the order. Extended attributes are extra attributes added to the NewStore platform during order injection/placement, typically requested and created by retailers themselves.
Note
There are 2 types of extended attributes:
Extended order attributes
Extended order item attributes
Currently, only extended order attributes can be displayed on the order detail page. It is not possible to display extended order item attributes. However, the extended order item attributes can be
included as part of the export
.
Displaying extended attributes
Within the orders in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, the extended order attributes are represented as:
Label: A human readable label to be shown in the sidebar of the orders in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Name: The extended attribute data that is included as part of the export.
Display: The way the extended order attribute value is displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
String: Freeform string below the defined label
Badge: Badge that is listed if the value is equal to "1". In case the extended order attribute is included but the value is "0" then the badge will not be shown
URL: Clickable link, where the link display is the defined label. The URL is appended with ->
There can be multiple extended order and extended order item attributes configured via the Config API.
To view the existing configuration for extended order attributes in your business, use the
List extended order attributes
method.
To display extended attributes in NewStore Omnichannel Manager:
Use the
Create extended order attributes
method.
In
value
>
order_extended_attributes
property:
Add a value for the
display
property.
Add a value for the
label
property.
Add a value for the
name
property.
Refer to the description of each field at the top of this section for more information.
NewStore Omnichannel Manager includes the extended attributes as part of the order detail page, if the information has been provided during order placement or injection.
Configuring order ID sequence parameters
When setting up your business for the first time, configure the order ID sequence parameters to enable IDs to be assigned to orders in the NewStore platform.
Important
Ensure that you specify the correct values for the sequence parameters. Once set,
do not
change these values.
To view the existing configuration for extended order attributes in your business, use the
Get order ID sequence parameters
method.
To configure the sequence parameters:
Use the
Set order ID sequence parameters
method.
In the
value
property, add a value for the following properties:
prefix
: A prefix for the order IDs.
size
: Size of the order IDs.
start
: Starting index for the order IDs.
step
: A counter that determines the next increment in the order IDs.
Important
NewStore ensures that each new order ID is incremented and greater than the previous one, and the difference between consequent IDs is always greater than or equal to the value you have configured in the
step
property.
During some instances, there can be an unusual increment of the order ID, such as long periods of no order placement activity, during a technical maintenance phase of the order database or when fixing errors during order placement in the platform.
Allowing DC-fulfilled order cancelation
NewStore Omnichannel Manager can be configured to allow orders to be canceled when they are fulfilled from a DC. See
Canceling an order
.
Note
Unless specified by the retailer using this configuration, all orders routed to stores for fulfillment can be canceled.
To configure DC-fulfilled order cancelation, use the
Set locations from which orders can be canceled
method and add
store
and/or
dc
to allow cancelation from both type of locations.
To view which locations have been configured in your business to allow cancelation of orders, use the
List locations from which orders can be canceled
method.
