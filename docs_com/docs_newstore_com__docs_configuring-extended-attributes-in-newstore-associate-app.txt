You can enable associates to add information to orders and order items in NewStore Associate App in the form of extended attributes. For example, you can enable associates to enter a gift message for an order or specify a custom engraving on a piece of jewelry, and more.
For each individual attribute, you can configure:
A unique name
(Optional)
A regular expression against which the input can be validated
A label and prompt message for the attribute, with translated versions for certain locales.
The
label
and
prompt
properties must have an
en
translation. Other optional locales that NewStore supports are:
de
es
fr
it
ja
ko
zh
A custom keyboard
Possible values for
keyboard_type
are:
default
email-address
phone-pad
decimal-pad
ascii-capable
url
twitter
(Optional)
A sibling property for order items
The
sibling
property acts as a pair to the extended attribute field you want to enable as an editable property in NewStore Associate App. See the
example
on how this works.
Important
Do not
confuse this feature with
adding extended product attributes
via a product import.
To retrieve the extended attributes added to an order or item via the app, use the
List extended order attributes
method. Currently, extended attributes added via the app to orders or order items are not displayed on the
Orders
page in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Note
Extended attributes added to products by retailers before or during an import are displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Do not
confuse these for the extended attributes added by associates using NewStore Associate App.
Values for extended attributes for orders or items can also be validated by the app, if this configuration has been set up via the API. See
this example
.
Configuring extended attributes for orders
Editable extended attributes for orders are disabled by default. To allow store associates to edit an extended attribute for an order:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
customizations
>
editable_extended_attributes
>
order
, specify an array of extended attribute configurations.
Example configuration for order attributes
See this example of an extended attribute configuration for orders in your business:
{
  "label": {
     "en": "Gift message",
     "de": "Geschenk Nachricht",
     "fr": "Message de cadeau"
   },
  "prompt": {
     "en": "Write your gift message here",
     "de": "Schreiben Sie hier Ihre Geschenknachricht",
     "fr": "Écrivez votre message cadeau ici"
   },
   "attribute_name": "gift_message",
   "keyboard_type": "default"
}
Once enabled, associates can add a gift message in NewStore Associate App:
In the app, add items to a cart.
Tap
More
>
Gift message
and enter the gift message in the dialog box that appears.
Tap
OK
.
Configuring extended attributes for items
Editable extended attributes for items are disabled by default. To allow store associates to edit an extended attribute for an item:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
customizations
>
editable_extended_attributes
>
item
, specify an array of extended attribute configurations.
Example configuration for item attributes
See this example of an extended attribute configuration for items in your business:
{
  "label": {
     "en": "Add engraving",
     "de": "Gravur hinzufügen",
   },
  "prompt": {
     "en": "Enter text to be engraved on jewelry",
     "de": "Geben Sie den Text ein, der auf Schmuck graviert werden soll",
   },
   "attribute_name": "engraving",
   "keyboard_type": "default"
}
Once enabled, associates can add an engraving to an item in NewStore Associate App:
In the app, add items to a cart.
Tap on an item in the cart
Tap on
Add engraving
and enter the custom message in the dialog box that appears.
Tap
OK
.
Example configuration for validated attributes
See this example of an extended attribute configuration for items, where the app validates the entered configuration values:
{
  "label": {
     "en": "Add engraving",
     "de": "Gravur hinzufügen",
   },
  "prompt": {
     "en": "Enter text to be engraved on jewelry",
     "de": "Geben Sie den Text ein, der auf Schmuck graviert werden soll",
   },
   "validation_regex": "^\\w{1,3}$",
   "attribute_name": "engraving",
   "keyboard_type": "default"
}
Once enabled, this configuration enables associates to add an engraving of 1 to 3 alphabetic characters to an item in NewStore Associate App:
In the app, add items to a cart.
Tap on an item in the cart
Tap on
Add engraving
and enter a custom message in the dialog box that appears.
If you enter a message that is different than 1 to 3 alphabetic characters in length or format, the app rejects the value and returns an error.
Example configuration for using the sibling attribute
The
sibling
property is available only for extended attributes for order items. Use this property to verify that associates can only add the configured extended attribute to products containing the referenced
sibling
attribute.
For example, if you have:
Specified that
engravable
is an extended attribute (specified in the
extended_attributes
property) for your products that allow engraving on them during the product import, and
Specified
sibling
as
engravable
in the
Update app configuration
payload, in
customizations
>
editable_extended_attributes
>
item
Then the
engraving
attribute field is displayed in NewStore Associate App. This field will also appear if no
sibling
property has been specified. If the value of the
sibling
property does not match the attribute specified for the item during a product import, the editable field is not displayed in NewStore Associate App.
See this example of an extended attribute configuration for items with a
sibling
property:
{
  "label": {
     "en": "Add engraving",
     "de": "Gravur hinzufügen",
   },
  "prompt": {
     "en": "Enter text to be engraved on jewelry",
     "de": "Geben Sie den Text ein, der auf Schmuck graviert werden soll",
   },
   "validation_regex": "^\\w{1,3}$",
   "attribute_name": "engraving",
   "keyboard_type": "default"
   "sibling": "engravable"
}
In the above example, the option
Add engraving
will only be shown for items that have the extended attribute
engravable
added to them during upload.
