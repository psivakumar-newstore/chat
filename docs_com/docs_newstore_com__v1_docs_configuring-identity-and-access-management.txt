Single Sign On
(SSO) allows your business to connect your existing corporate directory to the NewStore platform. Associates in your business can then log into NewStore apps using their existing corporate credentials. Supported identity providers include Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra Active Directory, Okta, or
Auth0
.
When users in your business are logging into NewStore apps, they use a NewStore provided directory backed by Auth0. You can connect your corporate directory in addition to the NewStore provided directory for authentication. Users are then directed to the NewStore login page, where they select their authentication provider before logging in.
For an example of how the login flow may vary for users in NewStore apps, See
Logging into NewStore Omnichannel Manager
.
To verify the identity providers configured for your business, use this
Config API
