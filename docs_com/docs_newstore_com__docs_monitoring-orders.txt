Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the View orders permission.
Note
To manage orders that have been put on hold, the On Hold Orders feature must be configured for your business. For help with this configuration, contact the
support team
.
Use
Search
to find orders that you want to view the details for.
When searching for orders, ensure that you enter the complete order ID if your search string exceeds 8 characters. If you use a partial order ID to search for the order, it will only work if the length of search string is less than or equal to 8 characters.
For example, to find an order with ID
GD000447079
, a search with
0447079
works, as it is less than 8 characters, but searching with
000447079
will not work.
Viewing order details
Click an
Order ID
to display its details.
Use this page to monitor all the details of the order and to download related documents.
For example, view the price details for an order, which include taxes levied on each item in the order. To view the breakdown of taxes levied on the order, click the displayed tax amount.
When the taxes are included in the price (
VAT
), the column title is
Tax Included
. If not, the column title is
Taxes
, which displays taxes levied separately on each item in the order.
To view the taxes levied on items being
refunded
for the order, click
Refund
on the order details page.
The latest note associated with the order or an item in the order is displayed below the product details area. To view all the notes associated with the order, click
See All
.
Notes are
added
via NewStore Associate App or programmatically via an API.
To create notes for an order, use the
Create order note
method.
To create notes for an item in the order, use the
Create item note
method.
Note
For in-store purchases, the associate can enter the customer details when creating the receipt. All details entered during this step appear in the customer information section in the left sidebar.
Updating the shipment status for external orders
In rare cases, an order cannot be fulfilled in the NewStore platform or the shipment status for fulfillment requests in an order may not be reflected correctly in the NewStore platform, including in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
For example:
An error in Associate App prevents associates from fulfilling an order, or
The shipping status update for 1 of 2 fulfillment requests in the order is not sent to NewStore due to a problem in the fulfillment provider's system.
In such cases, you can manually update the status of the shipment for the order via NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
You can programmatically enable this feature, using the
Fulfillment request configuration API
. For more information, see
Updating the shipment status of an order
.
Important
Before you mark order items as shipped, ensure that:
You know that no other associate is trying to fulfill the same order, and
You have the correct status of the shipment
In the
Open Fulfillment(s)
area, click
Update Status
for the fulfillment request for which you want to update the shipment status.
In the dialog box that appears, verify that all items in the fulfillment request have been marked as
Shipped
.
Note
Some items may have already been
Rejected
by the warehouse during fulfillment. These status for these items will not change.
If available, enter the following details and click
Review
:
Carrier
: The name of the shipping carrier that completed the shipment.
Tracking Number
: The tracking number for the shipment.
Important
Enter a tracking number for the shipment, to allow reconciliation of shipment and fulfillment reports in the platform later.
Reason for shipping externally
: The reason for marking the items as shipped via NewStore Omnichannel Manager. For example, the shipment cannot be booked in Associate App because of connectivity issues in the FedEx network.
Review the changes and click
Submit
.
Follow the same steps to update the shipment status for all open fulfillment requests in the order.
The updated fulfillment request is closed and moved to the
Shipments
area in the same page.
Retrying a payment or refund
In rare cases, a payment can be authorized but might fail during the capture or refund operation. In this situation, you can retry the operation:
Click an
Order ID
from the
Sales
page to open its details.
In the
Payments
section, expand the payment or refund to display its details.
If the payment or refund failed (
Capture Failed
or
Refund Failed
status
), a
Retry
button is displayed. Click it to retry the payment. The retry of the operation can take some minutes to complete.
Refresh the page after a few minutes and expand the operation again to check if the operation was successful.
Viewing offline orders
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the View orders permission.
The
Offline Orders
tab on the
Sales
page lists all the orders that have been
processed offline
in NewStore Associate App.
Click an
Order ID
to view its details. Use this page to monitor all the details of the offline order and to download related documents, such as sales receipts.
For offline orders and the
Offline Orders
tab to be visible in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, set the
showOfflineOrders
property to
true
programmatically via the
Config API
.
Managing On Hold orders
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage order exceptions permission.
Note
To manage orders that have been put on hold, the On Hold Orders feature must be configured for your business. For help with this configuration, contact the
support team
.
The
On Hold Orders
tab on the
Sales
page lists all the orders that are on
On Hold
.
On Hold
orders may have some or all items on hold.
The
Exception(s)
column displays the reason the order is
On Hold
. To display orders for a particular on-hold reason, filter the
Exception(s)
column by the reason. For example, filter by
Booking Delivery Validation Error
to display orders that cannot be shipped because of an error during order placement.
Automatically routing On Hold orders
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage order exceptions permission.
Automatic routing of orders that are
On Hold
because of insufficient inventory can be configured for your business. To enable this feature, see
Enabling order routing features
programmatically via an API.
To manage orders in NewStore Omnichannel Manager that are on hold for any other reason, see
Managing On Hold orders
.
Automatic rerouting attempts for
On Hold
orders due to insufficient inventory are triggered by two conditions:
Availability imports
: When new stock data is imported and an item becomes available, the system attempts to reroute the order after a short delay—if allocation is available.
Hourly checks
: Independently of imports, the system attempts to reroute all on-hold orders with insufficient inventory once per hour.
If either condition results in a valid fulfillment option, the order is routed automatically for fulfillment.
Important
Automatic routing does not reserve any allocations for the item during the delay. If the available items are sold out during this delay, the order goes back on hold.
When stock becomes available for a product, it is used to automatically route both on hold orders and new orders.
If stock runs out, some on hold orders may not be routed at all, while some new orders might be put on hold.
NewStore configures a global delay for all tenants.
If an
On Hold
order scheduled for automatic routing is canceled during the delay, the allocations available for the item do not change. If there are any
On Hold
orders waiting for allocations to be available for that item, they are not scheduled for automatic routing till the next availability import.
An
On Hold
prerouted order
is automatically routed only if allocations become available in the fulfillment location specified for the order.
Typically, NewStore routes oldest orders first based on the order creation date in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. Fulfillment locations that rejected fulfillment requests for an
On Hold
order are ignored when automatically routing the order.
Business case examples
Example 1
: When stock for all items in an order becomes available
An order has
Item A
and
Item B
on hold, and the stock for both items become available.
Available stock for
Item A
has no allocations for other orders.
Item A
is automatically routed for fulfillment.
Available stock for
Item B
has allocations for other orders. If the allocated stock is equal to or less than the available stock,
Item B
stays
On Hold
.
Example 2
: When stock for some items in an order becomes available
An order has
Item A
and
Item B
on hold, and the stock for only
Item A
becomes available.
If available stock for
Item A
has no allocations for other orders, the order is split and
Item A
is automatically routed for fulfillment.
Example 3
: When an
On Hold
order scheduled for automatic routing is canceled during the delay
There are 7 orders on hold because of insufficient inventory for
Item C
.
3
On Hold
orders are scheduled for automatic routing as stock becomes available.
4
On Hold
orders wait for more stock to be available in the next availability import.
During the delay, 1
On Hold
order is canceled. As the available allocations for
Item C
remain unchanged, the status of the 4
On Hold
orders waiting for available stock does not change.
The remaining 2
On Hold
orders are automatically routed for fulfillment after the delay.
You can choose to manually manage
On Hold
orders, which were not automatically routed, in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. See
Managing On Hold orders with insufficient inventory
.
Managing On Hold orders with insufficient inventory
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage order exceptions permission.
Note
To manage orders with insufficient inventory, the On Hold Orders feature must be configured for your business. For help with this configuration, contact the
support team
.
When items in an order are out of stock, the order cannot be assigned to a fulfillment location. The unavailable items are put
On Hold
and the order status is also
On Hold
.
To update an order that is On Hold because of insufficient stock:
Filter the
Exception(s)
column on the
Sales > On Hold Orders
page, by
Insufficient Inventory
.
Click the order ID. The
Exception(s)
section on the order details page displays different actions that you can perform on the order.
Click
Handle Exception
. The
Insufficient Inventory
window is displayed. Resolve the inventory conflict for each item in the order.
To check if stock for the item exists at other locations, click
Check available inventory
, for each item.
Based on availability for the item, you can choose one of the following actions, from the
Select action
drop-down list:
Cancel Item
: The item is canceled and will not be delivered. The
Payments
section displays the amount refunded for the canceled item.
Reroute Item
: The item is rerouted to a fulfillment location that has stock. Items that are prerouted to a specific location
are not rerouted with this option
. When you reroute an item, NewStore tries routing it using the shipping method that was used for the order originally. If this shipping method is unavailable, NewStore tries routing the item based on the priority of shipping methods specified for your business.
For more information, see the
tutorial
or the
API
.
To route the item to a different location, use
Route to specific location
.
Swap With Another Item
: Enter the SKU of the replacement item and confirm that you contacted the customer about this substitution. This option is not displayed if your business does not offer swaps for On Hold items.
Route to specific location
: The item is rerouted to a fulfillment location that you specify. This manual routing option is not displayed if your business does not allow routing On Hold items to a specific location.
When you reroute an item to a specific location, NewStore tries routing it using the shipping method that was used for the order originally.
Note
Routing rules, ATP, and available shipping methods are not checked for the item when you route to a location manually. Ensure that you check if the item is available, and the preferred shipping method is supported, at the fulfillment location that you specify.
See
Enabling swaps for On Hold items
and
Enabling manual rerouting for On Hold items
to programmatically enable these features.
The Order details page displays the status for each order item. Click the status to see the activity for the item.
Managing On Hold orders with shipping provider delivery problems
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage order exceptions permission.
Note
To manage orders with a shipping provider delivery problem, the On Hold Orders feature must be configured for your business. For help with this configuration, contact the
support team
.
When items in a shipment, which is part of an order, cannot be delivered by the shipping provider using the
provider rate
specified in the NewStore platform, the items in the shipment are put on hold. Allocations for these items are released immediately.
The status of the order also changes to
On Hold
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. However, this does not affect the status of other shipments or in-store pickup items that are part of the order.
For example, an order is routed to a store in Germany and a domestic
service level
from FedEx is specified for fulfillment. The order will go on hold if FedEx needs to deliver such orders using an international service level.
To update an order that is
On Hold
because of shipping provider delivery problems:
Filter the
Exception(s)
column on the
Sales > On Hold Orders
page, by
Carrier Service Delivery Problem
.
Click the order ID. The
Exception(s)
section on the order details page displays different actions that you can perform on the order.
Click
Handle Exception
. The
Carrier Service Delivery Problem
window is displayed. Resolve the inventory conflict for each item in the order.
To check if stock for the item exists at other locations, click
Check available inventory
, for each item.
Based on availability for the item, you can choose one of the following actions, from the
Select action
drop-down list:
Cancel Item
: The item is canceled and will not be delivered. The
Payments
section displays the amount refunded for the canceled item.
Reroute Item
: The item is rerouted to a fulfillment location that has stock. Items that are prerouted to a specific location
are not rerouted with this option
. When you reroute an item, NewStore tries routing it using the shipping method that was used for the order originally. If this shipping method is unavailable, NewStore tries routing the item based on the priority of shipping methods specified for your business.

Fixing a Shipping Address Error
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage order exceptions permission.
If the recipient's address is invalid on an order, the Associate App returns a
Shipping Address Error
when the associate tries to generate a shipping label. In this case, the order status is changed to
On Hold
. The shipping label cannot be printed during packing and associates cannot proceed with in-store fulfillment.
To resolve this problem, update the shipping address in Omnichannel Manager:
Navigate to
Store Operations
-
Delivery
-
Shipment Booking Errors
.
Search for the order using the Order ID.
On the problematic order, click the
Edit Shipping Address
link in the
ERROR_TYPE
column. This option is only available if there is an issue with the shipping address.
In the
Overview
box, check the
Last known error
. It provides information about what needs to be updated.
Update the problematic field(s) in the
Shipping Address
.
Click the
Update
button to finalize the changes.
After these steps, you can see that the address was successfully updated under
Sales
-
Orders
. When the address is corrected, the order status changes to
Printing
, and the fulfillment process can continue.
Reviewing big orders
Note
To review big orders, the On Hold Orders feature must be configured for your business. For help with this configuration, contact the
support team
.
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage order exceptions permission.
If configured, orders that contain many items may require additional approvals before they are processed any further in NewStore. These orders are in
On Hold
state and are not routed to a fulfillment location until they are approved. The number of items that an order can contain is decided by your business and configured by NewStore.
To display the
On Hold
tab for the retailer, see
Displaying On Hold orders
.
To review a big order:
Filter the
Exception(s)
column by
Big Order
, to display big orders that are On Hold.
Click the order ID to display the items in the order.
In the
Exception(s)
section, click
Handle Exception
. The
Big Order
window is displayed.
Review the order to confirm if the order must be processed.
From the
Select action
drop-down list: To route the order to a location, choose
Approve order
. To cancel the order and notify the customer, choose
Cancel order
. Select a cancelation reason.
Click
Submit
.
When you approve the order, the order status changes to
Routing
and can continue in the fulfillment workflow.
Managing orders stuck in Routing status
Orders are routed immediately after the grace period, to locations that can fulfill the order. An order that is stuck in
Routing
indicates that it needs your attention.
On the
Sales > Orders
page, filter the
Status
column by
Routing
.
Click the
Date/Time
column. Sort by
Ascending
to see the oldest orders first, or by
Descending
to see the newest orders first.
Click each order to view order details. Before you contact the support team, click the status in the order details to see the reason associated with the order status, to be sure that there is nothing you can do to address the problem.
Contact the
support team
for help with completing this order.
