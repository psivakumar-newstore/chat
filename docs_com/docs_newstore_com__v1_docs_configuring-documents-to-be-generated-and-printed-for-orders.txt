With the
new store fulfillment flow
, you can configure documents to be generated and printed for each customer order. These documents include packing slips, invoices, shipping labels, and return labels.
You can set a global documents configuration across all stores in your business or a store-specific configuration that will override the global configuration.
Setting up a global documents configuration
To set a global documents configuration, use the
Update global documents config
method.
We support the following documents to be generated and printed:
invoice
Include this in your configuration if you want to generate an invoice.
packing_slip
Include this in your configuration if you want to generate a packing slip.
shipping_label
Include this in your configuration if you want to generate a shipping label.
return_label
Include this in your configuration if you want to generate a return label.
commercial_invoice
Include this in your configuration if you want to generate a commercial invoice.
Note
The shipping adapter provides the commercial invoice when
booking the shipment
. This can only be generated for some orders, and can only be added as a default
optional
document.
in_store_pickup_label
Include this in your configuration if you want to generate an in-store pickup label. (Only for
in_store_pick_up
document type.)
A sample configuration:
{
    "default": ["invoice", "packing_slip", "shipping_label", "return_label"],
    "default_optional": ["commercial_invoice"],
    "in_store_pick_up": ["invoice", "in_store_pickup_label"],
}
To check your documents configuration, use the
Get global documents config
method.
Setting up a store-specific documents configuration
If you have a store for which you need different documents to be generated and printed, use the
Update store-specific documents config
method.
Scenario:
Consider you have stores in different countries but in Japan you don't need to print a return label. In this scenario, you can use the
Update store-specific documents config
method to set the documents configuration for each store in Japan.
The store-specific documents config can be removed using the
Delete store-specific documents config
method.
Use the
Get store-specific documents config
method to check if you have an existing store-specific documents configuration.
