Content pages such as the terms & conditions and FAQ pages of the website can be reused in the shopping app. Typically You can find links to these pages below the notifications settings in the "account" section of your app. The content pages are mobile responsive web pages from your site.
Web versus native
In order to create a seamless mobile experience it’s important to remove the web navigation and web links on these in-app pages. This way, customers won't notice the difference between web content and native content.
The web navigation can be confusing for customers. They might start shopping on your mobile site inside your app and get lost. Removing the web navigation and links will prevent this from happening.
When a content page is opened within the app the url parameter
inApp=true
will be present on the first request (eg www.brand.com/faq?inApp=true). This parameter can be used to determine if the website is being viewed within the context of the app or not. Note that this parameter will only be present on the first request so you should set a flag within the session storage so that any subsequent pages that are viewed within the same session will also be treated as being viewed within the app.
The following elements should be hidden when viewed in the app:
header and footer
navigation that doesn’t make sense within the app eg breadcrumbs
Country selector
Cookie Banner (a user will have already seen the cookie banner in the native app)
