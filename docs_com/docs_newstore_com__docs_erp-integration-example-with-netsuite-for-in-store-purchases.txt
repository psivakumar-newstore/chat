This example uses NetSuite as the ERP system for the retailer to integrate with, to sync in-store purchases in the NewStore platform. If you integrate with ERP systems other than NetSuite, contact the
support team
.
To successfully create NetSuite orders from NewStore orders, map fields (such as
channel identifiers
) from NewStore values to NetSuite values. The necessary static maps are described in the following sections.
You can also use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to supply integration lambdas with these maps as an implementation option.
Channel map
Maps from NewStore channel types (
web
or
store
) to the corresponding numerical NetSuite identifiers.
Map name in sample implementation:
netsuite/newstore_to_netsuite_channel
Location map
Provides the following NetSuite attributes for each NewStore store location:
NetSuite store ID
NetSuite subsidiary ID for the store
A placeholder customer name and email used for in-store purchases for situations where no actual customer information is present.
Map name in sample implementation:
netsuite/newstore_to_netsuite_locations
Payment method map
In NetSuite, each payment needs to be represented as an order line item. The payment method map provides a virtual NetSuite product ID for each NewStore payment method. This information enables the integration to create suitable NetSuite payment line items, corresponding to the received NewStore payment information.
Map name in sample implementation:
netsuite/newstore_to_netsuite_payment_items
List of gift card product IDs
You need this list to map a gift card payment to the corresponding product ID, when creating a NetSuite payment order line for a gift card payment.
Map name in sample implementation:
netsuite/newstore_giftcard_product_ids
Shipping method map
Maps the shipping service levels configured as part of the NewStore fulfillment configuration to corresponding NetSuite shipping method identifiers.
Map name in sample implementation:
netsuite/newstore_to_netsuite_shipping_methods
Currency map
While NewStore uses three-letter ISO codes for currencies, NetSuite uses numeric identifiers. The currency map maps between these two representations.
In the sample implementation, the
currency_map
is part of a collection of multiple configured constants, maintained in the map
netsuite/iso_to_netsuite_currencies
.
CashSale Record Type
For each NewStore in-store purchase order, create a
CashSale
transaction in the ERP system.
To create the
RecordRef
type, you only need the ID of the related record type. See the following example to create a
RecordRef
for the
partner
attribute with ID
2
:
'partner': RecordRef(internalId=2)
The mapping table from NewStore order data, as provided by GraphQL, that syncs with NetSuite CashSale attributes:
Cash Sale Record Type attribute
Type
Comment
NewStore attribute
customForm
String
This is the NetSuite form identifier for the CashSale record type, as configured in NetSuite. The only way to create NetSuite transactions from an integration is via a custom form, as entities like CashSale cannot be created directly.
NA
partner
RecordRef
This is the partner identifier of NewStore, as configured in NetSuite.
NA
subsidiary
RecordRef
This is the subsidiary of the retailer where the sales happen. The subsidiary is determined by looking it up for the store, using the
Location map
.
order.demand_location
location
RecordRef
This is the store defined in NetSuite. Like the subsidiary, the NetSuite location ID is looked up in the
Location map
.
order.demand_location
externalId
String
order.id
currency
RecordRef
NetSuite currency identifier, as retrieved from the
Currency map
.
order.currency
tranDate

customFieldList
CustomFieldList
This is a list of custom fields that are defined in NetSuite by the retailer. The list of these custom fields and their meaning is available from the responsible Solution Architect.
See
CashSaleItemList Record Type
.
Entity Record Type
Use the following mapping table to create a new customer in NetSuite:
Entity Record Type attribute
Type
Comment
NewStore attribute
customForm
String
This is the NetSuite form identifier for the customer create form.
NA
firstName
order.shipping_address.first_name

CashSaleItemList Record Type
Cash sale item list includes the list of order items and the list of payment items.
CashSaleItem Record Type attribute
Type
Comment
