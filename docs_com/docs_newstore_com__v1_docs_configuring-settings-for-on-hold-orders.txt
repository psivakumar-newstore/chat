Displaying On Hold orders
This feature is enabled by default for a retailer to be able to manage orders that have been put on hold.
Important
This feature cannot be disabled, as you cannot fix an incorrect address for an order, or manage a big order or an order that is On Hold for insufficient inventory reasons.
Configuring order cancelation and On Hold settings
These settings determine if orders must be canceled when in conflict or if the orders are On Hold and managed on NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Most retailers choose to prevent orders from being canceled automatically, and this is the recommended configuration.
If you want cancelation settings for orders in conflict to be overridden for orders associated with a specific conflict reason, you can specify reasons to override default cancelation settings.
For example, to put orders that are in conflict on hold, because there isn't enough stock for the items in the order, you can specify the overriding reason as
insufficient_stock
.
To retrieve the current configuration, use the
Get order cancelation policies
method.
To prevent orders in conflict from being canceled:
Use the
Create order cancelation policies
method.
To prevent any order from being canceled automatically, specify
default
as
false
.
If
default
is set to
true
, in
value
>
reasons_to_overwrite_default
, specify a list of reasons to prevent orders from being canceled. The following values can be specified:
insufficient_stock
failed_fulfillment_node_mapping
shipping_offer_update_error
error
not_enough_stock_to_create_allocation
Orders that are in conflict for
insufficient_stock
reasons are displayed as On Hold orders in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. See
Managing On Hold orders with insufficient inventory
.
Orders that are in conflict because of
failed_fulfillment_node_mapping
or
error
reasons are not displayed explicitly to retailers and they must contact the
support team
for more information.
A
failed_fulfillment_node_mapping
error implies that the order is stuck because the fulfillment location specified to fulfill the order does not exist in the fulfillment configuration.
Ensure that you have specified the correct fulfillment location during a stock import using the
Import API
. You can also use the
Get fulfillment configuration method
to verify the set of fulfillment locations available for your business (specified within the
routes
property of the response payload).
If you choose to not prevent orders in conflict from being canceled, and no reasons are specified to overwrite cancelation, all orders with conflicts are canceled.
For information on enabling swapping On Hold items, see
Enabling swaps for On Hold items
.
Configuring settings for large orders
You can set specific limits for items that orders can contain in your business. For example, you can specify the maximum number of items an order can contain, exceeding which it is put on hold or canceled.
Based on these values, an order is either routed immediately, put on hold, or is canceled. For example, if the soft limit is 300 and the hard limit is 800, orders with up to 299 items are routed immediately. Orders with items between 300 and 799 are put on hold and require approval. Orders with more than 799 items are automatically canceled.
To view the soft limit for orders configured for your business, use the
Get limits on items for large orders
method.
To manage the soft limits for orders in your business:
Use the
Set limits on items for large orders
method.
Specify a value in the
soft_limit_for_big_orders
property, such as
300
.
