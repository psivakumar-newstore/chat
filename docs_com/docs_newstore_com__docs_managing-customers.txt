Managing customers
You can use NewStore Associate App for
clienteling
purposes by making sure that every customer that you serve is added to the app's
My Customers
section. This speeds up future checkouts and allows you to gather data about your customer's preferences.
Note
When you make a sale, and a new customer provides an email address during checkout, a profile is automatically created.
Checking if a customer exists in the app
The
Recently Viewed
section, displays the last 3 customers you searched for.
Tap
to open the customer list.
Type the customer's name (or a part of it), or the customer's email, in the search bar and check the result list.
The
Activity
tab displays the customer's omnichannel purchase history, that includes the items the customer purchased, the amount they spent, and the channel they used to make the purchase.
