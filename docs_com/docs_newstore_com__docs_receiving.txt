Use
Enabling inventory receiving
documentation to enable count feature
Inventory receiving is a critical process in retail operations, ensuring accurate stock management and seamless store functionality. The platform supports two levels of receiving:
SKU-Level Receiving
: Retailers can verify and track received Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and quantities with precision.
Carton-Level Receiving
: Allows retailers to assume all products are included in a shipment without individual verification, streamlining the process.
This flexibility enhances operational efficiency, minimizes errors, and provides real-time visibility into inventory levels, improving stock accuracy and order fulfillment.
Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN) generation
ASNs can be created using two methods:
Shipments from Distribution Centers (DCs) to stores
: ASNs are generated via an API.
Store-to-store transfers
: The platform automatically generates a transfer receipt in the receiving store when the transfer is completed at the origin store.
Advanced receiving capabilities
The platform also supports additional receiving features:
Blind Receiving
: Allows store associates to receive orphan packages without supporting documentation or tracking information.
Over-Receiving
: Supports scenarios where shipments exceed the quantity specified in the ASN.
These features empower retailers to optimize their inventory receiving processes, ensuring greater accuracy, efficiency, and control.
