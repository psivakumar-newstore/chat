Clienteling Introduction
NewStore is excited to offer Clienteling functionality built directly into the existing NewStore platform and tools that users leverage every day!
From NOM, administrators can easily manage which stores are enabled for Clienteling, the templates to be used for outreach, and even assign lists of customers for specific stores to contact. Clienteling metrics are surfaced within the Insights Dashboard empowering the data driven to understand their performance, set goals, and measure progress against them.
From the Associate App store associates can capture customers, communicate, and sell remotely, all in the one application they already know. Leverage a wealth of information in the Customer Profile, such as the order history, to help inform conversations and send product or purchase links using the Remote Cart functionality.
Here we will provide documentation on everything you need to know, not only to get started with Clienteling, but to build a successful Clienteling program that empowers your associates to develop closer relationships with your customers, delivering a measurable ROI.
