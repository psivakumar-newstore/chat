A retailer can ship orders internationally for their business using the EasyPost adapter. To enable international shipments, in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud, the retailer must assign an associate or manager in the store whose name appears on the
commercial invoice
. This person is responsible for the accuracy of the information in the invoice and that it is ready for customs processing.
To configure the name of the associate or manager:
Retrieve the customs information for fulfillment locations handling international shipping in your business using the
Get customs config
method.
Use the
Update customs config
method.
For each fulfillment location in your business that you want to ship orders internationally from, in the
value
>
fulfillment_node_id
>
customs_signer
property, specify the person whose name will appear on the commercial invoice.
