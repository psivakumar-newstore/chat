You can use external identifiers such as a Electronic Product Code (EPC) in NewStore Associate App to track products throughout the order lifecycle—whether in-store or during order fulfillment.
Associates can use NewStore Associate App to scan the QR Code on the RFID tags of each item at checkout and at the
packing
stage during order fulfillment. The captured EPC is sent downstream to the RFID Inventory Management Systems to enable accurate inventory.
Adding products with EPC to the cart in NewStore Associate App
No additional app configuration is required to enable EPC capture. Once the associate scans the QR code with the EPC on the RFID tag, the product is identified and the app displays the EPC value throughout the checkout and fulfillment process. Similarly if an RFID reader is set up at the checkout station, the EPC is captured via the connection, product is identified and EPC is displayed in the app throughout the checkout and fulfillment process.
The same EPC also appears on customer orders in Associate App and on sales orders in Omnichannel Manager.
Important
EPC is not tracked with inventory transactions.
