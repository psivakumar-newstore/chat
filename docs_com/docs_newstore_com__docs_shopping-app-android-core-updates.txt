Improvements
üí™
Filter and Sort button review for accessibility
The
Filter and Sort
button now changes background color based on its active or inactive state. The background color, in combination with the dismissal button, helps users understand whether filters or sorting options are currently applied. This is a step forward towards
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
readiness.
Toolbar headings review and tags for accessibility
Updated all toolbar headings to include proper heading tags. Screen readers like TalkBack can now announce the screen titles as soon as the screen loads. This provides immediate context for users and assists in smoother navigation. This is a step forward towards
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
readiness.
Release v1.138.0
Release date: March 31, 2025
We're excited to announce a new version of Android core v1.138.0, which brings single-choice filters for more granular user filtering options, enhanced peak time reliability with improved autoscaling, and a fix where combining favorite synchronization and remembered last size resulted in incorrect product configurations.
Improvements
üí™
Single-choice filters
Added support for single-choice filters (
equality search
). Now, brands can offer more granular filtering to their user, such as a price discount percentage filter. For example, up to 10%, up to 30%, or up to 50%.
Peak time reliability with autoscaling
Improved autoscaling across various backend services to ensure further platform reliability and resilience during peak time. Now, you can direct traffic to your Shopping App even more confidently.
Bug fixes üêû
Favorites Synchronization and Remember Last Size
Fixed an issue where using
Favorite Synchronization
together with
Remember Last Size
feature caused the wrong product configuration to load when opening a product from the
Favorites
list.
Release v1.137.0
Release date: March 10, 2025
We're excited to announce a new version of Android core v1.137.0. This release includes adaptations for accessibility, a new Quick Action Button, improved push notification handling for Emarsys, and various technical improvements.
New features
üéâ
Dynamic text sizes for accessibility
The Android app supports dynamic text sizes. Users can now adjust text sizes via system settings for a more inclusive experience. This enhancement aligns with the
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
requirements. The act ensures that digital products and services, including e-commerce apps, are accessible to people with disabilities or impairments.
Early Access: Quick Action Button
The
Quick Action Button
allows brands to highlight one essential feature to their Shopping App users, for example, a live chat, loyalty program dashboard, or support hub. Customers can instantly access the key app screen using this button from anywhere in the Shopping App.
This is a floating button that can be dragged up and down. It always remains visible and allows seamless navigation to a defined view or App Extension in the app. The button is configurable by country and language and can be enabled without requiring a new app update.
This feature is in Early Access. Contact your Omnichannel Success Manager to have this enabled.
Improvements
üí™
Account form
Added the ability to hide the account editing form in the Account tab. Brands now have greater flexibility in choosing where users can edit their details.
UI elements labels for screen-reader accessibility
Added descriptive labels to the user interface elements to improve screen-reader accessibility. Labels make it easier for visually impaired users to navigate and use the app with a screen-reader. This is a step forward towards
European Accessibility Act (EAA)
readiness.
Bug fixes üêû
Push notifications
Push notifications sent from SAP Emarsys without a deeplink will reliably navigate users to the app.
Product configuration
The configuration button now redirects users to App Extensions also for products without configuration options.
