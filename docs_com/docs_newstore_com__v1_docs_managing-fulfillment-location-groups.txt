Important
This feature is
only
available if you have:
Started using the new fulfillment configuration process using the
Routing ruleset
and
Service levels
APIs. To migrate from your old fulfillment configuration to the new routing framework, see
the migration guide
.
Updated store capacity via the
API
.
If you are unsure about the current capacity of stores where the new routing strategy applies, set an empty
policy
using the following payload:
{
     "policy": {}
    }
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the
View routing configuration
permission.
Use NewStore Omnichannel Manager to manage location groups in your business, which contain fulfillment locations that can fulfill orders. You can also use this page to:
View and manage the priority of fulfillment locations in each location group, based on which locations are selected by the platform to fulfill orders
Manage capacity of stores to fulfill orders placed in your business
Add or remove locations from location groups
Enable or disable a fulfillment location from fulfilling orders
The page provides you with a holistic overview of all routes and fulfillment locations in your business to help manage your fulfillment configuration better.
All changes made to your locations and location groups are effective real-time.
Note
You cannot create location groups via the UI in Omnichannel Manager. To set up routes and location groups, use the
Routing ruleset
API. For more information, see
the tutorial
.
Adding a fulfillment location to a location group
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage routing configuration permission.
To add fulfillment locations to a location group:
Log into Omnichannel Manager and go to
Routing
>
Locations
.
Select the location group you want to add a fulfillment location to.
In the details screen, click
Add Location
and select the fulfillment locations you want to add to the location group and click
Apply to fulfillment nodes
.
The location is added to the location group. You can now proceed to enable it to fulfill orders or manage the fulfillment capacity for the location.
Removing a fulfillment location from a location group
To remove a fulfillment location from a group:
Log into Omnichannel Manager and go to
Routing
>
Locations
.
Select the location group from which you want to remove fulfillment locations.
For the location that you want to remove, click
Edit
and in the dialog box that appears, click
Remove
.
The location is removed from the group. If needed, you can add another location or the same location back into the group at any time.
Enabling or disabling a location for order fulfillment
For more information on enabling or disabling locations from fulfilling orders, see
Disabling locations from fulfilling orders
.
To enable a location to fulfill orders:
Log into Omnichannel Manager and go to
Routing
>
Locations
.
Select the location group, and click
Edit
for the location where you want to enable order fulfillment.
In the dialog box that appears, enable
Accept Fulfillment Orders
and click
Save
.
The
Fulfillment
column in the location group screen displays
Enabled
and the fulfillment location can now start fulfilling orders.
To disable a location from fulfilling orders, disable
Accept Fulfillment Orders
and click
Save
for the specific location, following the same steps as described above.
Managing order fulfillment capacity for a location
If required, you can specify the maximum number of items that a store can fulfill in a day. This means that if you specify routing capacity as
4
for the store, a maximum of 4 items can be routed and picked for order fulfillment from the store, even if the stock on hand or ATP is higher than that number.
Important
You cannot assign order fulfillment capacity restrictions for warehouses.
Assigning order fulfillment capacity for stores only works when you use the
default routing strategy
for your business. You cannot specify store capacity limits when
prerouting orders
to specific locations.
For more information, see
Managing capacity-based routing for stores
.
To specify the routing capacity for stores:
Log into Omnichannel Manager and go to
Routing
>
Locations
.
Select the location group, and click
Edit
for the location where you want to modify order fulfillment capacity.
Select
Override default capacity
and enter the number of items that the store can pick and route for fulfillment in a day.
Note
By default, stores have unlimited routing capacity.
If you specify the maximum routing capacity for a store as
0
, then the store will stop receiving fulfillment requests, even though there is ATP for items in the store.
Setting routing capacity for a store to
0
will technically disable the store from fulfilling orders (except for in-store sales transactions).
Click
Save
.
The updated capacity is reflected under the
Daily item capacity
column in the location group screen, against the location you have modified the number for.
Important
The
Items fulfilled today
column displays
-
instead of the actual number of fulfilled items when:
No limit is set for the maximum routing capacity for a store, or
The number of items fulfilled cannot be calculated because the store has reached its fulfillment capacity, is closed, or is non-operational for the given time of the day
-
denotes that NewStore could not calculate the actual number of items fulfilled by the store at that moment. If no items were fulfilled by the store, and the above conditions do not apply, NewStore displays
0
instead of
-
in the same column.
Managing the priority of fulfillment locations in a location group
Important
Changing the priority of a location in a group affects the fulfillment priority in all shipping zones that use this location group. If you are using geographical grouping, then this doesn't affect your fulfillment strategy.
But if you are using an alternative logic to group locations, ensure that you know what you are doing. The priority of locations will be updated in all shipping zones that the location group considers and can adversely affect how orders are fulfilled in your business.
If required, you can specify which fulfillment locations will be selected first to fulfill orders in your business in a specific location group. The priority of fulfillment locations is set in ascending order in the list of locations in a group.
For example, in this location group, the warehouse
DC01
has the highest priority while the store
NY-store
has the lowest priority when orders are routed to these locations for fulfillment.
NY-store
is only selected if all the other locations above it in the list cannot fulfill the order.
To reorder the priority of locations in the group:
Log into Omnichannel Manager and go to
Routing
>
Locations
.
Select the location group, and click
Reorder Priority
.
Drag and drop locations to the top or bottom of the list based on the updated priority of locations within your group.
Click
Save
.
