(NewStore mobile consumer-facing application(s))
Overview
NewStore has aligned its mobile consumer-facing application development processes and technology to meet the requirements set by the European Accessibility Act (Directive (EU) 2019/882), one of the most comprehensive accessibility regulations for e-commerce services. In addition to our in-house development and quality assurance teams, NewStore engages independent third-party accessibility experts to provide audits and certification of our applications. Our mobile consumer-facing applications are designed and tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 Level AA standards, with relevant considerations from WCAG 2.2 AA, ensuring a high level of accessibility for all users. Principles of inclusive design and accessibility have been core to NewStore's development philosophy, which has facilitated our ongoing compliance with evolving accessibility standards.

Ongoing Compliance
Alignment with WCAG 2.1/2.2 AA standards allows us to meet the requirements of the European Accessibility Act and other international accessibility frameworks.
Testing Methodology
Multi-Platform Approach
NewStore employs a rigorous testing methodology that combines:
Manual testing using platform accessibility tools (TalkBack, VoiceOver, Accessibility Scanner, Accessibility Inspector)
Keyboard navigation testing with external keyboards and platform-specific accessibility features
Testing with increased text sizes and display accommodations (contrast, grayscale)
Code review against WCAG 2.1/2.2 requirements and platform-specific guidelines
Use of automated accessibility checkers where applicable
