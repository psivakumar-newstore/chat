There are two ways to ship orders at NewStore:
DC or warehouse fulfillment
Store fulfillment
During DC fulfillment, a DC or warehouse ships the order according to a fulfillment request sent by NewStore. See
About order fulfillment
for more details about the fulfillment process. The sending of fulfillment requests, and the receiving of the responses from the DC happens in the integration layer. See
Integrating a fulfillment provider
for more details.
The lifecycle of the
fulfillment_request
entity during DC fulfillment is represented by the diagram below using the
BPMN notation
..
This diagram refers to events that are emitted as part of the event stream. See the
entity model
and the
webhook
for further details on those.

Sending a fulfillment request
The fulfillment process begins when NewStore platform sends a fulfillment request to a DC. When this happens, the
fulfillment_request.assigned
event is emitted.
Accepting the fulfillment request
If the DC accepts the request, no events are emitted from the platform. When the DC starts shipping the item(s) of the request, the
fulfillment_request.items_completed
event is emitted.
Once NewStore receives confirmation from the DC that the items have been shipped, the
invoice.created
event is emitted.
Rejecting the fulfillment request
The DC may be unable to fulfill the order. This can happen immediately after it has received the fulfillment request or after it has accepted the fulfillment request. In both situations, the
fulfillment_request.items_failed
is emitted.
Note
For orders fulfilled by a
DC
, when an item is rejected in a fulfillment request, the
status
of the item changes to
On Hold
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. However, the rejected item is processed in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud only after all the other items in the fulfillment request have been processed.
