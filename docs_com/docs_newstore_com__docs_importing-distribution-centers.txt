There is no explicit way to create distribution centers (DCs) on your own. When you import stock, the location of the stock is automatically created as a
fulfillment_node_id
in NewStore. To indicate that the fulfillment location in
fulfillment_node_id
is a distribution center, ensure that the
store_id
is set to
null
.
NewStore can create DCs for your business. For more information, contact the
support team
.
