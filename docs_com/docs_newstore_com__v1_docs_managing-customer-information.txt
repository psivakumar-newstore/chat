Permission Required
This action can be performed by users with the View customers permission.
The
Customers
tab in NewStore Omnichannel Manager allows you to manage your customers. All customers that an associate sees in NewStore Associate App are also displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Searching for and filtering customers
To search for customers, click the
Customers
tab.
Type the customer's name, email address, or phone number in the search box and press Enter. To sort the search results by a column, click the column header. You can sort by creation date/time, customer name, email, phone, the associate and the store for in-store customers.
Each header you click is added to the current filter as a filter criterion.
Displaying customer details
To see a customer's details, click
Customer ID
. This identifier helps you differentiate customers with similar name and contact information in your business.
The left sidebar displays details about when, where, and by whom the customer was created.
To see details of the customer's order and purchase history, click the order ID in the
Purchase History
section. The
Customer ID
is also displayed in the customer's order details.
Editing customer details
PERMISSION REQUIRED
This action can be performed by users with the Edit customers permission.
To edit customer details, click the
Customers
tab. Click the
Customer ID
. You can edit the customer's name, email, phone number, billing and shipping address. The
Customer ID
identifies the customer and helps you differentiate customers with similar name and contact information in your business.
Note
You can change the email address for a customer. However, the same email address can't be added to multiple customers.
Merging customer profiles
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Merge customers permission.
To merge two customer profiles:
Navigate to the
Customer Overview List
. Alternatively, you can merge profiles from the individual customer profiles.
Click
Merge Profiles
and follow the on-screen instructions to select the source and destination profiles.
The
source profile
is the one that will be merged and then deleted.
The
destination profile
is the one that will be retained and updated with relevant information from the source profile.
The merge follows the rules described in the next sections.
Merge rules for profile details
When merging profiles, the following rules apply to the profile details (email, name, phone number):
The email of the destination profile is retained, and the source profile email is deleted.
If these details are specified in the destination profile, they remain unchanged.
If these details are not specified in the destination profile, they are transferred from the source profile.
Examples:

Destination Profile Value
Post-Merge Destination Profile Value
Example
