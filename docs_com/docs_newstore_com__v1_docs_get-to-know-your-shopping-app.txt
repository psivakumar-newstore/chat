NewStore Shopping App is a native mobile application designed to enhance users’ shopping experience by providing an engaging platform for getting inspiration, driving loyalty, browsing, and purchasing products. NewStore Shopping App is based on three 'experience pillars':
Shopping experience
The apps offer a fully native (iOS, iPad OS, Android) shopping experience to let DTC brands present their brand and products in the best possible way. The experience is designed to be effortless, inspirational, and personal. The app leverages native-only features like rich and personal push notifications. It offers a variety of features that facilitate product discovery, streamline navigation, and enhance the overall purchasing process. It also offers unique shopping features like image and video lookbooks and stories.
Loyalty experience
In addition to being a high-converting shopping app, it offers a range of membership features allowing brands to connect deeper with their customers and increase customer lifetime value. Features like personal push notifications, member promotions, membership card, vouchers, levels and points collection make the loyalty program simple and accessible.
Store experience
The third pillar of the shopping experience offers a feature set that improve the experience when consumers interact with a brand store. Features like Store Mode (opening a designated store view when customers are in the store), BOPIS, store inventory, and more enhance the store visit and improve the overall unified commerce brand experience.
Main functionalities
Upon launching the app, users are greeted with a customizable splash screen and a consent banner that ensures compliance with data tracking regulations. The home wall serves as the central hub, featuring content based on user preferences, including product lists, brand stories, and promotional tiles. Users can easily navigate through different categories, refine their search results, and make informed purchasing decisions through detailed product pages.
Home wall
The home screen acts as the primary entry point for users, providing personalized content that encourages exploration and engagement. By offering quick access to categories and tailored recommendations, customers can easily find products that interest them, leading to increased conversion rates.

App Extension
App Extension empowers your brand to add custom content and functionality (store appointments, gamification, interactive blogs) to your app by including mobile-first webviews into the user journey. The

allows the web content to interact with native app functionality. For example, add to cart or add to favorites. Or deeplink to native view, like a product category or detail view. The user experience is untouched as the transition happens without users’ notice thanks to the native title bar and bottom bar.
This comprehensive feature set creates a powerful Shopping App that not only facilitates purchases but also builds brand loyalty, enhances customer engagement, and provides valuable data for continuous improvement of the shopping experience.
