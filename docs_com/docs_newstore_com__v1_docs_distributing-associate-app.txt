Understand how to distribute NewStore Associate App using Apple Business Manager.
Important
This example uses
simpleMDM
as an MDM application to distribute NewStore Associate App. Actual steps to distribute NewStore Associate App for your business may vary based on the MDM application you use.
Prerequisites for selecting an MDM application
Ensure that the MDM application you want to use to distribute NewStore Associate App supports AppConfig.
NewStore recommends using
simpleMDM
or
jamf Pro
as MDM applications, as we provide full support for them. NewStore does not guarantee support for distributing NewStore Associate App via any other MDM applications.
Note the following about NewStore Associate App when it is distributed with Apple Business Manager:
It is built with NewStore's Distribution Certificates.
It is distributed using NewStore's App Store Connect Account.
It is downloaded using your Apple Business Manager account, which allows you to distribute the app manually or using an MDM.
Apps published privately in App Store Connect cannot be seen in the public App Store, but can be downloaded via Apple Business Manager.
Prerequisites
Enable
Custom Apps
in Apple Business Manager.
In Apple Business Manager, go to
Settings
and select
Enrollment Information
.
Ensure that
Custom Apps
is set to
Enabled
.
(Optional) Connect your MDM to Apple Business Manager.
To download your server token, in your Apple Business Manager account, go to
Settings
>
Apps and Books
>
My Server Tokens
, and click
Download
.
Upload the server token to your MDM application.
The name of your organization (
Organization Name
) and your
Apple ID
should appear in the list.
Requesting access to Associate App
Ensure you have an Apple Business Manager account. See
ABM
.
In Apple Business Manager, in the lower left corner, click
Settings
>
Enrolment Information
.
Send your Apple Business Manager
organization name
and the
Organization ID
to your contact point at NewStore.
You contact point will inform you when your organization is configured on the NewStore side.
In the same screen, in the
Custom Apps
section, click
Enable
.
(Optional)
If you use an MDM application, ensure your devices are enrolled in Apple Business Manager.
Go to the
Content
>
Custom Apps
section, you should see the app. It might take a few minutes to appear once NewStore has added your organization ID to its setup.
Important
Your NewStore apps will appear in the
Custom Apps
tab, and not in the
Apps and Books
tab.
Getting licenses
In Apple Business Manager, click
Custom Apps
and click the app name.
In the app details, find
Licence type
and select one of the following options:
Managed
: use this option if you have an MDM application.
Redemption Codes
: use this option if you want to manually distribute the app.
Select the number of apps you require and click
Get
.
It might take some minutes for you to have access to the licenses. The available licenses appear in
Custom Apps
>
Manage Licenses
. Once ready, you can either use your MDM application to distribute the app, or share the redemption codes.
For more information about licenses, see the
Apple documentation
.
Syncing with your MDM
Before you start distributing, sync your NewStore apps in the MDM application you are using. The available licenses should appear in the MDM now.
In the
Catalog
or
Apps
tab in your MDM application, the list of NewStore apps and associated licenses should appear.
If you cannot see the NewStore apps or available licenses in your MDM application, contact the support team.
Configuring Associate App before distribution
Currently, you can use
Managed Configuration Support
to configure NewStore Associate App in your MDM application before distribution:
In your MDM application, go to
Catalog
>
Managed Configuration Support
.
Configure the following keys (an example is shown in the screenshot below):
test
: Specify the tenant string provided by NewStore, to be used for testing the app. The string includes a
-staging
in the name as a suffix.
live
: Specify the tenant string provided by NewStore, to be used for using the app in a live environment. The string does not include
-sandbox
or
-staging
as a suffix.
(Optional)
storeId
: Specify the store ID to which the device is going to be assigned for the tenant. For more information on enabling associates to automatically switch stores, see
Using your credentials
.
Important
If both the
test
and
live
keys have been configured and set, Associate App opens in the
live
environment by default when launched or opened. Associates can then manually switch to the
test
environment if needed.
Important
This configuration is required
only
for
new
retailers with tenants available only on the
production
environment. To properly set
existing
retailers in the platform with tenants on
staging
and
production
environments, set the following keys:
stage
: Specify the stage for the apps (
p
for production or
s
for staging).
tenant
: Specify the name of the tenant.
(Optional)
storeId
: Specifies the store ID to which the device is assigned for the tenant.
Using TestFlight to access beta builds
Important
We use
TestFlight
as a tool to access beta builds before the official release of a new version of Associate App. It is provided and maintained by Apple, and offers quick access via an Apple Account.
To receive access to a beta build, you must request access to an external testing group. These are created and maintained by NewStore. NewStore will provide an invitation link to onboard you to the testing group.
Once onboarded, every build uploaded to TestFlight is accessible and the user is notified.
Request an external testing group from NewStore.
Download
TestFlight
from the
App Store
for the iPhone that you want to use it for.
Open the public invitation link provided by NewStore to onboard onto the testing group.
Tap
NewStore Associate App
to open the menu for the app.
Tap
Install
to download the latest version or tap
Previous builds
to choose a build to download.
The version and build number are provided by NewStore.
You must bootstrap the downloaded Associate App versions via TestFlight. Either scan a provided QR code or enter this URL in the Safari Browser of your device:
com.newstore.associate-one://bootstrap?live={tenant}&test={tenant-staging}
Add an additional
storeId
parameter to create an
automatic assignment
to a store for any user logging in.
com.newstore.associate-one://bootstrap?live={tenant}&test={tenant-staging}&storeId={store-id}
Configuring Associate App with a PLIST configuration file
Most of the MDM applications require a
ManagedAppConfig.plist
file to be uploaded. This PLIST file contains the necessary keys to configure the application during the distribution to the devices.
Ensure that the
live
and
test
values have been set in the PLIST file.
Note
(Optional)
Specify a value for the
storeId
to which the device will be assigned to, so that associates are automatically assigned to this store when they log into the app on this device. See
Using your credentials
.
A sample PLIST configuration file is provided here:
```plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>live</key>
    <string>YOURTENANT</string>
    <key>test</key>
    <string>YOURTENANT-staging</string>
    <key>storeId</key>
    <string>YOUR-STORE-ID</string>
  </dict>
</plist>
```
If you are using
Meraki
as your MDM application, you may have to copy the values manually to your
AppConfiguration
file. For more information, see
Using the Managed App Settings Payload
.
Users of
jamf
could run into issues using the sample config above. In this case, only use the part between
<dict>
and
</dict>
.
FAQs
Is it possible to share IPA (iOS AppStore Package) files?
Apple does not officially support sharing IPA files directly for general distribution. IPA files are meant to be distributed through Apple's official channels, such as the Apple App Store or through Apple's enterprise distribution methods. Here are some methods recommends by Apple:
App Store : The most common method, where apps are submitted, reviewed, and then made available to the public or in specific regions via the App Store.
TestFlight : Apple's official beta testing service,
TestFlight
, allows developers to share their apps with a limited number of testers before the app is released in the App Store.
TestFlight
also enables the installation of specific versions of the app.
Sharing IPA files outside of these official channels pose security risks, as users would need to trust the app and manually install it. This has the potential to bypass important security checks and updates provided by the App Store.
Is it possible to limit the distribution to specific version using MDM?
No, MDM synchronizes with the App Store. So, whenever a new version is available there, it is also available to MDM. However, you can choose whether to roll out the new version to devices.
Until the new version is installed, users can continue using the old version unless it is deleted from the device. This means that while the MDM cannot control the availability of app versions, it can decide whether to install the new version or remain on the older version.
