Logging in

Note
By default, you are assigned to the store that you were last assigned to when using the app in the previous online session. This can only be changed via
Omnichannel Manager
.
NewStore does not add the ID of the store associate to an offline order in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
To log into NewStore Associate App, See
Logging in
.
Switching to offline mode
When the device is offline, NewStore Associate App displays a banner that notifies the associate.
Associates must switch to
Offline Mode
manually, such as when there are problems with the NewStore server or during checkout, or when the device loses internet connectivity.
To switch to
Offline Mode
:
Close NewStore Associate App if you are already using it, and long press the app icon.
Tap
Offline Mode
.
Creating a shopping cart offline
To create an offline shopping cart and add in-store items to it:
Switch to
Offline Mode
.
Tap
Create offline cart
>
Add product
.
Scan the price tag of the item requested by your customer.
(Optional) To manually enter the barcode or SKU of the item instead of scanning, tap
.
Note
By default, product catalogs are not available offline. However, you can enable the app to store the catalog locally on the device for product validation when operating in offline mode.
This is
only a visual indication
, so users may still submit unknown or invalid products.
To enable the app to look up the catalog offline, see
Enabling offline catalogs
.
Validate or add the price of the item.
Note
The offline data is downloaded when an associate logs in while the app is still online. This means that the offline price data can be outdated. However, you can always manually change the price to specify the correct prices or to offer a discount to the customer even when the app is offline.
To enable offline prices, see
Enabling offline prices
.
Ensure that the price of the item includes taxes. If the price does not contain the tax for the item, enter the tax rate manually in
Tax rate
.
The tax amount appears on associated receipts as
Manually Entered Tax
.
Tap
Add to Cart
.
The items are added to the offline cart.
Repeat these steps for all the items you want to add.
To remove an item from the cart, swipe left on the item and tap
Remove
.
To stop the purchase and start again, tap
X
. All items are removed from the cart.
Checking out an offline shopping cart
The offline cart contains all the items that the customer wants to purchase. After you have added the items in the offline cart, proceed to check them out.
To start the checkout and payment process:
In the
Offline Cart
screen, tap
Pay
.
In the
Select Payment
screen, choose the preferred payment option of the customer.
Choosing a payment option
Choose the payment option requested by the customer. Currently NewStore Associate App supports the following payment options when the device is offline:
Cash
: Accept cash.
Tap
Cash
and type the amount paid by the customer. The amount of change that is owed to the customer is displayed.
Tap
Next
and proceed to
complete the purchase
.
Important
Cash payments do not get logged into the Cash Management cash drawer balances when offline transactions are processed. In order to account for offline sales using cash, customers should leverage the non-sale transactions to add the proper cash amounts to the drawer to aid in drawer balancing and reconciliation once the system is back online.  As a common practice, customers typically use the “Transfer In” non-sale transaction with a transaction type of “Offline sale” to add cash to the drawers once their application is back online.
Offline Credit Card
: Accept a credit card payment using a credit card reader (or POS device).
Important
The payment service provider must also support credit card payment capture when offline, such as a
Standalone Mode
for Adyen payment devices. To use
Standalone Mode
, use supported terminals with a built-in printer, such as S1F2 or V400c Plus. Other supported devices include e285, e355, and V400m, but with some conditions. See
Configuring Adyen payment devices to accept offline payments
.
To enable the payment device to capture payments made offline, see
Configuring Adyen payment devices to accept offline payments
.
Sales orders that are processed in offline-mode using offline credit card will not include any payment references in the NewStore Omnichannel Manager view. Reconciliation of sales order and credit card payments will need to be handled manually by matching offline orders and payment transactions within the applicable payment platform.
Tap
Offline Credit Card
and switch to the POS device.
Follow the on-screen instructions in NewStore Associate App and accept the payment made via the customer's credit card.
After the payment has been captured, tap
Complete checkout
and tap
Confirm
. Proceed to
complete the purchase
.
If the payment was not captured correctly in the POS device, tap
Cancel
and restart the payment capture process.
Important
When using offline mode and processing payments using the offline credit card option, NOM will display the
Payment Method
as “Offline Credit Card” however, the
Processor
line item for the payment will always display “cash”. This does not impact the state of the cash drawer nor does this get reflected within the cash counts.
Processing returns of OffLine Orders
If a customer wants to return an item, initially paid using a credit card when NewStore Associate App was offline, the store associate can leverage these options for a refund:
New Gift card
: Issues a new gift card for the refund amount. This option may not be available if your store's policies don't allow refunds to gift cards.
Enter the following details if required by your business and tap
Add Gift Card
:
Gift Card Number
PIN
for the gift card
the customer's email address
New Electronic Gift card
: Issues an electronic gift card for the refund amount, which is sent to the customer's email address.
Present Card for Refund
: Allows you to swipe the credit/debit card that should receive the refund.
Note
Currently, you cannot enter a credit/debit card number manually to receive the refund.
Original Payment Method
: Refunds to the original payment method that was used to pay for the item via an external order management system.
For orders that were paid for via external payment options such as
WeChatPay
or
AliPay
, this option is disabled by default. Use the
External Payment Method
to refund the amount instead.
Important
This refund method only works if the order number for the returned item, from the external order management system, was entered during the return process.
Note
- If the customer used several credit cards to pay, each credit card is refunded for the amount that was deducted from it. - Certain debit cards cannot be refunded without swiping them again. In this case, use the
Present Card for Refund
option.
Completing the offline purchase
After the customer has paid for the order, to complete the checkout:
Enter the details of the customer. An order receipt is sent to the customer's email address when you
submit the offline order
later.
Note
If you do not provide the email address of the customer at this step, no receipts are shared with the customer via NewStore Associate App.
Tap
Done
to complete the offline purchase.
Submitting offline orders
When the device is back online, associates must submit the orders processed offline in NewStore Associate App, so that they are uploaded to the platform and visible in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. When an order is submitted, related sales receipts are also uploaded to NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
To submit an offline order, go to
...
>
Offline Mode
, and tap
Submit Orders
.
Note
The sale is attributed to the associate who submits the orders, irrespective of who completed the
offline purchase
.
The order is uploaded to the platform. A manager can
view these offline orders
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Reviewing offline orders
When submitting an offline order after the app is back online, NewStore validates the barcode or SKU of the items in the order. If the order validation fails because of an invalid barcode or SKU, review the order and re-enter the barcode for the items in the order.
For each offline order that cannot be submitted because of invalid or incorrect product IDs:
Tap
Review Orders
in the screen that appears when you try to submit an offline order with items that have an invalid barcode or SKU.
In the orders screen, tap the order(s) that displays
Resolve issue
.
In the
Offline Order
screen, tap the product that has an invalid product ID.
Note
Products with an invalid barcode or SKU have the
Product note found in the catalog. Please change the barcode.
hint text displayed against them.
In the
Resolve issue
screen that appears, enter or scan the correct barcode for the product.
After you have added the correct barcode or SKU for a product, the order is ready for submission.
You can also change the product before submitting an order, if you scanned the wrong item when creating the offline order.
Note
- You can only change the product that had an incorrect barcode or SKU assigned to it when the offline order was created. Products added to the offline order with a correct barcode or SKU cannot be changed. - NewStore does not log the edit history for products in offline orders. When you submit an offline order, only the final product ID is uploaded to the platform. Ensure that you have specified the correct product before submission.
Tap
Submit Order
to submit the offline order, then tap
Close
in the screen that appears when the order is submitted successfully.
The order is uploaded to the platform. A manager can
view these offline orders
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
