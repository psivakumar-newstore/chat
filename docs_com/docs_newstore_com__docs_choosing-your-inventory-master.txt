To manage inventory-related operations and data, you can use an ERP or NewStore as
inventory master
.
Important
NewStore does not support reverting to an ERP
after
you have enabled NewStore as inventory master in the store. Ensure that you want to use NewStore as inventory master before you switch from an ERP.
An ERP as inventory master
When you use an ERP as inventory master in a store or DC in your business:
The
stock on hand
in the store includes items that have been shipped or handed over from the store (
in-store pickup
) since the last stock import. The stock on hand for:
Shipped items is updated in real-time.
Items that are part of inventory transactions (such as transferred or adjusted inventory) is updated after a new stock import. See the note below.
Allocations for shipped items are removed immediately from the NewStore platform.
Important
Use the
Event stream
to sync inventory back to the ERP after in-store inventory management operations have been completed. See
Syncing inventory transactions using the Event stream
.
NewStore as inventory master
Only stores can use NewStore as inventory master, not DCs.
Important
NewStore is not the inventory master for stores in your business by default. To enable a store to use NewStore as inventory master,
programmatically configure the location as inventory master
.
NewStore does not support reverting to an ERP
after

When you use NewStore as inventory master for a store in your business:
The stock on hand in the store is updated in real-time. NewStore calculates the stock on hand based on inventory transactions and items shipped from the store,
using stock locations
.
Note
Shipped items may include items that are part of inventory transfers or adjustments.
Allocations for shipped items are removed immediately from the NewStore platform.
You can use an
API
to programatically import stock on hand directly for your stores, which can then be used for:
A
full count
of the items in the store.
An initial
stock
import into the store, when the store starts using NewStore to manage all inventory-related operations and data.
Important
To set up NewStore as inventory master in a new store, import stock into the store with the availability set to
0
. After enabling NewStore as inventory master in the store, perform a cycle count to update the stock levels to the correct values.
If you import stock with quantities higher than
0
but without a subsequent cycle count, then the stock on hand shows up wrongly as available in the store when you perform an
availability export
.
Note
When you switch from an ERP to NewStore as inventory master in a store, an initial stock import is required to calculate the real-time stock on hand for the store. This can be achieved via
API
.
Switch from an ERP to NewStore as inventory master immediately after a stock import into the store. This ensures that NewStore, as the new inventory master, has the accurate stock on hand for the store.
When importing stock, ensure that stock is not moved between stores due to in-store purchases, store fulfillment, or inventory movement.
NewStore recommends that all cycle counts created in NewStore due to a
mispick
are completed before starting a stock import.
