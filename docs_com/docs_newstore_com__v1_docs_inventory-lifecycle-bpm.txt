NewStore allows you to manage inventory and stock for your business via external ERP systems, which integrate with NewStore Omnichannel Cloud, and Associate App.
The inventory lifecycle at NewStore is represented by the diagrams below using the
BPMN notation
and relies on concepts such as order fulfillment and
inventory management
. These concepts are described in the
Business process
section.
All fulfillment data and inventory transactions processed in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud are synced back to ERP systems in your business using the
Event stream
.
For more information, see
Managing inventory sync with the Event stream
and
Syncing inventory transactions using the Event stream
.
Important
This BPM is applicable for you when NewStore is an
inventory master
, and not an ERP system, to manage fulfillment-related data and inventory processes in your business.
Inventory operations
Info
Currently, NewStore supports limited inventory operations via Associate App.
This diagram refers to events that are emitted as a part of the event stream. See the
entity model
and the
webhook
.

Receiving inventory
Associates can use Associate App to receive inventory from another store or DC.
To use Associate App to receive inventory, see
Receiving inventory
.
Inventory can be received with an
ASN
, or with other references such as a
purchase order
or
transfer order
.
After the inventory is received, the stock on hand for the store is updated in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud, and the
inventory_transaction.items_received
event is emitted.
Transferring inventory
Associates can use Associate App to transfer inventory to another store or DC.
To use Associate App to transfer inventory, see
Transferring inventory
.
When the inventory transfer is initiated in Associate App, the
inventory_transaction.transfer_order_created
event is emitted by the platform.
Inventory can be transferred with shipment or without shipment.
If the inventory is transferred from the store with shipment, the
inventory_transaction.items_ready_for_handover
event is emitted.
If the inventory is transferred from the store without shipment, the
inventory_transaction.asn_created
event is emitted.
Once the inventory is shipped from the store, the stock on hand for the store is updated in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud.
Adjusting inventory
Inventory is adjusted in your store via Associate App to adjust
stock on hand
for the store in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud.
When inventory has been adjusted in the store, the
inventory_transaction.adjustment_created
event is emitted.
Counting inventory
Stock in your store is counted via Associate App using a
cycle count
.
An associate counts the products specified in the cycle count transaction and submits the count to complete the process. Any discrepancies found during the counting process by the NewStore platform is displayed in Associate App, which can then be reviewed manually.
When the counting process is completed, the
inventory_count.items_counted
event is emitted.
Inventory operations with NewStore Omnichannel Manager

Transferring inventory
Use NewStore Omnichannel Manager to track the statuses of transfer orders. You can also close the open or pending transfer orders if needed.
For example, you want to transfer 10 items of product A back to the warehouse. However, the store contains only 9 items that can be transferred, making the transfer order partially complete. You can close such transfer orders manually in Omnichannel Manager. For more information, see
Closing a transfer order
.
After the transfer order is closed,
The stock on hand for the store is updated in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud.
The
inventory_transaction.transfer_order_closed
event is emitted by the platform.
An ERP is notified about the status of the transfer order.
Closing an ASN
An
ASN
is closed in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud when an inventory transaction is complete. You can also close the ASN manually. In either of these cases, the
inventory_transaction.asn_closed
event is emitted by the platform and an ERP is notified about the status of the inventory operation through their integration. For more information, see the
Integration guides
and
Event-Stream Webhooks
documentation.
