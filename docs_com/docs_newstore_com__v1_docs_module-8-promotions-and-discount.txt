We're thrilled to announce our partnership with Dodici, a prestigious luxury fashion brand from Milan, Italy. To elevate customer satisfaction, Dodici's VP of Retail has outlined key objectives, including:
Support for Omni Coupons
Automatic Discounts
Manual Discounts
To meet these requirements, we'll configure the Coupons, Automatic Discounts, and Manual Discounts feature on the NewStore platform. This will deliver a seamless, customer-centric experience that aligns with Dodici's high-end brand standards.
Retailers frequently employ various promotions and coupons to boost sales and attract customers. These incentives can take the form of global promotions, applicable across all stores, or targeted offers specific to individual locations. To further enhance the shopping experience, store associates are often empowered to provide manual discounts at their discretion. These discretionary discounts may be offered for reasons such as damaged products, expired items, or to simply appease a dissatisfied customer. By providing associates with this flexibility, retailers can foster a more personalized and responsive shopping environment. Ultimately, this blended approach to promotions and discounts enables retailers to drive sales, build customer loyalty, and stay competitive in a rapidly evolving market.
Success Criteria
Upon completing this module, you will gain the skills to:
Configure coupons with and without qualifying criteria
Set up automatic promotions with and without qualifying criteria
Configure manual discounts with and without predefined reasons
By mastering these skills, you'll be able to effectively manage promotions and discounts, enhancing the overall shopping experience for your customers.
