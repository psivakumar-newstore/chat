We're thrilled to partner with Dodici, a prestigious luxury fashion brand from Milan, Italy, to ensure a smooth transition to NewStore. The VP of Retail has outlined key objectives to elevate customer satisfaction, including:
Extending product offerings beyond physical store inventory
Allowing stores to sell both in-store and non-in-store products in a single transaction, boosting average order value
To achieve these goals, we'll configure the  and  features on the NewStore platform, providing a seamless and customer-centric experience that meets Dodici's high luxury brand standards.
By enabling the sale of products with inventory in other locations, retailers can significantly boost revenue and enhance customer experience. Additionally, retailers will be thrilled to offer mixed cart functionality, allowing customers to receive part of their order in-store and have the remaining items shipped to their address. This innovative approach not only increases average order value but also elevates customer satisfaction in several ways:
Streamlined transaction process for multiple fulfillment methods
Potential for better discounts and promotions due to higher order totals
Enhanced convenience and flexibility for customers
Increased chances of qualifying for more attractive promotions and loyalty rewards
By offering this seamless and flexible shopping experience, retailers can differentiate themselves, build customer loyalty, and drive business growth.
