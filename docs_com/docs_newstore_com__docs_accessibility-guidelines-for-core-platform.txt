NewStore has aligned its mobile application development processes and technology to meet the requirements set by the European Accessibility Act (Directive (EU) 2019/882), one of the most comprehensive accessibility regulations for e-commerce services. Our mobile applications are designed and tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2.1 Level AA standards, with relevant considerations from WCAG 2.2 AA, ensuring a high level of accessibility for all users. In addition to our in-house development and quality assurance teams, NewStore engages independent third-party accessibility experts to provide audits and certification of our applications. Principles of inclusive design and accessibility have been core to NewStore's development philosophy, which has facilitated our ongoing compliance with evolving accessibility standards and ensures our retail partners can confidently provide accessible shopping experiences to all customers.
