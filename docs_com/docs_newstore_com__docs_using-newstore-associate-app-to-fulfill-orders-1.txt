Order Fulfillment
dashboard.
Note
To configure order documents to be generated and printed, see
Configuring documents to be generated and printed for orders
.
Wave fulfillment
Waves are groups of orders that you can create for order fulfillment. A wave can include a maximum of 50 orders, but the default is 10. When creating a wave, you specify the order count and select the following types:
All Types
, which includes all types of orders (including carrier and customer pickup orders)
Customer
, which only includes customer pickup orders
Carrier Pickup
, which
only
includes carrier pickup orders
When a wave is created, orders with the oldest order date (the date when the customer placed the order) are prioritized and added to the wave.
Note
When priority orders are not enabled, they do not appear in the list of order types to add to a wave.
Priority orders
You can use
Priority orders
to decide which order
service levels
are prioritized over other orders when performing wave fulfillment via Associate App.
Carrier pickup orders with priority service levels are displayed in an additional order list that associates can use to create
Priority Order
waves, ensuring that the most important carrier orders are ready to hand over as soon as possible.
When an associate creates a
Carrier (Priority)
wave, NewStore prioritizes orders based on their designated service levels and order age (the date when the customer placed the order), ensuring that the oldest orders with the highest priority are added first.
When creating other wave types for fulfillment, NewStore first evaluates the service level and then the order date. If an order is not a carrier priority or is a customer pickup order, NewStore prioritizes orders based on the order date. However, orders with priority service levels are always given precedence over other orders.
To enable this feature, see
Enabling priority orders in store fulfillment
.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
For priority service levels, create a list of service levels sorted from top to bottom, with descending order of priority from the top to the bottom. Create this list via the
Store fulfillment configuration API
.
Important
Only service levels considered for priority orders are included in the list of
Carrier (Priority)
orders.
Configuring the push notifications for store fulfillment
Note
This feature is supported from Associate App v1.56.0.
If you want to be notified about updates on fulfillment requests, configure the push notification settings in the app before starting to use fulfillment.
Note
Ensure that NewStore can send notifications such as alerts, sounds, and icon badges on the device. If notifications have not been allowed, push notifications will not be available on the device.
To enable push notifications, use the Associate App Configuration API to set
release_toggles
>
push_notifications
to
true
.
Log into Associate App.
Tap
Settings
>
Notification Settings
>
Store Fulfillment
.
Enable
Order Received - Regular
to be notified when a regular order is received.
Enable
Order Received - Priority
to be notified when a priority order is received.
The notification settings are turned off by default, which can be turned on to allow each associate to personalize their settings based on store traffic and workload.
Note
The fulfillment push notifications work along with the iOS notification settings. Associates are notified in or outside Associate App based on the configuration set for notifications on their device.
Creating waves
Before creating waves, ensure that you:
Select the type of order that you want to fulfill. For example, customer, carrier pickups or priority orders.
Specify the number of orders that you want to fulfill. You can fulfill maximum 50 orders in a single wave.
To create waves of orders:
Go to the navigation drawer and tap
Fulfillment
.
On the
Order Fulfillment
dashboard, you can see the following metrics:
Orders Not Started
In Progress Orders
Ready Orders
Customer Pickups
Carrier Pickups
Tap
Fulfill Orders
to continue picking order items.
Picking regular order items
You can pick many items without scanning their barcodes, however you must confirm the number of units you picked for each item.
For all carrier pickup orders, which can also contain carrier priority orders, orders are prioritized based on:
The service level(s) matches the service levels configured as priority order service levels in the
Store fulfillment configuration API
.
If there are priority pickup orders with the same service level as regular orders, NewStore prioritizes older orders based on the order date and adds them accordingly in the order wave.
In the
Select Order Type
screen, choose a type of order that you want to fulfill from:
All Types
Customer
Carrier (All)
Carrier (Priority)
Note
When you select
All Types
, which can include customer pickup, carrier pickup, and carrier priority orders, orders are prioritized to be added to a wave based on service levels. If orders have the same service, they are then prioritized based on the order date, where older orders are given priority over newer ones.
To pick priority order items, see
Picking priority order items
.
Tap
Confirm Order Type
.
Next, in the
Specify Order Count
screen, enter the number of orders.
Tap
Start Picking
to begin picking items.
Tap
...
and add items by tapping the
+
button.
Tap
Confirm
>
Complete Picking
to finish picking items. Now you can either start packing or return to the dashboard.
Picking priority order items
You can pick many items without scanning their barcodes, however you must confirm the number of units you picked for each item. For priority carrier pickup orders, orders are prioritized and added to the
Carrier (Priority)
list based on whether:
The service level(s) matches the service levels configured as priority order service levels in the
Store fulfillment configuration API
.
If there are priority pickup orders with the same service level, NewStore prioritizes older orders based on the order date and sorts them accordingly in the priority order wave.
To pick priority order items:
In the
Select Order Type
screen, choose
Carrier (Priority)
.
Tap
Confirm Order Type
.
Next, in the
Specify Order Count
screen, enter the number of orders.
Tap
Start Picking
to begin picking items.
Tap
...
and add items by tapping the
+
button.
Tap
Confirm
>
Complete Picking
to finish picking items. Now you can either start packing or return to the dashboard.
Mispicking order items
You have to confirm mispicks because of various reasons. For example, the lack of inventory.
When you mispick the order items, the ATP of the product is reduced to
0
and the cycle count is triggered if it was enabled for the store. After the mispick, the items associated with the order are removed and the entire order is re-routed to another location. If mispick happens for a BOPIS order, the order is placed on-hold to be investigated by a Store Fulfillment Manager.
After you start picking items, if they are missing or damaged, remove them by tapping the
-
button.
Tap
Items Not Available?
and
Confirm
the mispick.
Tap
Complete Picking
to finish mispicking items. Now you can either start packing or return to the dashboard.
Note
You can find the
Not Started
and
Ready to Pack
order items on the dashboard. Any associate can start working on these in-progress items based on the priority of the order.
Packing order items
For packing items, you must scan each item that you picked.
Tap
Start Packing
to pack items.
Tap on the order you want to pack.
From the list of picked items, choose the product to be packed.
Tap on the product and open the scan view.
Scan the barcode on the products. In case the product is serialized and has a QR code containing an Electronic Product Code (EPC), the app will decode this code and bring the product.
In the next screen, select one of the following options:
Not available for fulfillment
for items that are missing or damaged.
Enter barcode
to scan barcode of items or enter them manually to continue packing items.
Tap
Print
after packing the items.
Once you pack the items, you can keep them in a single package or move them into separate packages.
Single package shipment
By default the items are shipped with a single package.
Multi-package shipment
Tap
...
>
+ New Package
to move items to a new package.
Mispacking order items
You have to confirm mispacks because of various reasons. For example, damaged items.
When an order is mispacked, the ATP of the product is reduced to
0
and a cycle count is triggered, if enabled for the store. After the mispack, the items associated with the order are removed and the entire order is re-routed to appropriate location. If mispack happens for a BOPIS order, the order is placed on-hold to investigate by a Store Fulfillment Manager.
When items are fulfilled from a warehouse or DC, the impact of a mispack on ATP is different. See
Mispack
.
Tap
Decline Order
for items that are missing or damaged.
Specifying reasons for mispicked or mispacked items
Early Access
If you are interested in early access to this feature, ask your point of contact at NewStore or contact your Omnichannel Success Manager to enable this feature for you.
When enabled for your business, you can select one of the following pre-defined reasons to specify why an item had to be mispicked or mispacked in Associate App:
Damaged
Cannot be located
Reserved
The list of reasons is displayed during the picking or packing step when you specify that item(s) in an order cannot be fulfilled. This allows your business to understand why orders could not be fulfilled and result in inventory and operational optimization for stores.
This data is also
available in NOM
for further reference and audit if required.
Printing order documents
After the items are packed for the order, the order documents become available for printing.
Tap
Print
and select the printer. Now items are sent to the printer. You can reprint invoices and shipping labels.
Tap
Complete Packing
. The order is now ready for customer or carrier pickup based on your choice. Now you can return to the dashboard.
Setting up printers
For more information, see
Setting up a printer
.
Printing errors
If you are unable to print shipping labels or return shipping labels for the order, the order cannot move forward to the next step. When the order documents are successfully printed, then the order status changes to
Awaiting Handover
.
In spite of printing errors, you can fulfill external orders. For more information, see
Updating the shipment status for external orders
.
Handing over orders
Orders that are picked, packed, and processed successfully are displayed on the
Order Fulfillment
dashboard.
These orders are segregated into two categories based on the pickup of your choice.
Handing over orders to customers
You can select the orders from the
Customer pickup
category and hand them over to the customer.
Tap
Customer Pickups
.
Select the item for pickup.
Tap
Confirm Handover
.
Handing over orders to carriers
You can select the orders from the
Carrier pickup
category and hand them over to a carrier from the list of carriers.
Tap
Carrier Pickups
.
Tap
Hand Over All
or tap
View Orders
to verify the order details.
Tap
Handover
to confirm the handover of all items to the carrier.
The handover to carriers can happen in two ways:
Manual handover
When the carrier doesn't support a way to automatically indicate that orders have been handed over, the associate can manually handover the items to the carrier.
Automated handover
Some carriers provide a webhook that can interact with the NewStore platform. When the carrier scans the barcode of the package to be handed over, Associate App changes the status of the order to
Handed over
automatically.
Handing over orders using Single Scan Form
Upon request from a shipping service provider, NewStore can create a document called
Single Scan Form
. This documents lists out all order items to be picked up with a single barcode. The carrier scans the single barcode to confirm handover of all orders during manual pick up. The associate must deliver all orders at once when the single scan form is printed for a carrier.
For help with creating a single scan form, contact the
support team
.
Canceling orders
For more information on managing orders to be canceled, see
Monitoring orders
.
Searching orders
You can achieve the following using the
SEARCH
tab:
Browse a list of all orders that have been assigned to be fulfilled from your store.
Note
The orders displayed in the list are sorted so that orders which had an action taken on them most recently are displayed first.
The list currently only shows orders marked as
Handed Over
from the last 7 days.
Select and fulfill specific orders for which fulfillment has not started yet (marked as
Not Started
). For example, orders which have been escalated by the customer or special VIP orders that need immediate attention can be searched for and fulfilled first.
Search this list by Order ID and also see the date & time when an action was taken for the order.
Select an order and view more details such as:
Customer name
Package details including the products that were included in the order. This is useful for situations where the only identifying information the associate has about an order is a box with products in it.
Product prices
Reprint the documents associated with the order such as invoices, labels, and slips.
