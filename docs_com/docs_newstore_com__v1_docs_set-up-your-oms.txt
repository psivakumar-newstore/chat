NewStore’s Order Management System (OMS) enables retailers to efficiently handle orders from creation to fulfillment, supporting multi-channel sales and providing tools to manage complex order workflows. This system streamlines order processing, inventory control, and customer communication, helping businesses improve operational efficiency and enhance the customer experience.
Key features
Order Processing and Tracking
OMS automates and manages each stage of an order’s journey, from placement to delivery. For example, if a customer orders online, OMS automatically updates the warehouse, tracks the order’s progress, and notifies the customer and business at each stage.
Inventory Management
OMS provides real-time inventory visibility, helping businesses prevent stockouts and streamline restocking. For instance, if an item runs low, OMS alerts the retailer, allowing them to maintain adequate inventory levels and meet customer demands effectively.
Centralized Order Management
This feature consolidates orders from various sales channels, including online and in-store, enabling retailers to monitor and manage all orders in one place. This centralization ensures consistent handling across channels and simplifies the tracking of multi-source orders.
Customer Communication
Automated messaging keeps customers informed with order confirmations, shipping updates, and delivery notifications. This transparency enhances customer trust, as they are regularly updated on their order’s status.
If you are a retailer managing both online and in-store orders, with NewStore OMS, you can automatically route online orders to the nearest warehouse, update customers with tracking information, and ensure that inventory levels are maintained across all locations. This seamless process enhances efficiency, helping the retailer meet customer expectations and reduce operational delays.
For retailers who do not want to use NewStore’s native order management sytem, but want to leverage Associate App (mobile POS) from NewStore and their own legacy OMS, you can choose to
integrate an external OMS
