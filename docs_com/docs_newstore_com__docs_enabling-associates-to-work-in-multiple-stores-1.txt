This guide will describe the
MultiStore
feature, which enables Associates to automatically get assigned to the Store they are currently operating in without the need of a manual reassignment using NOM. The Associate will be assigned to the store during the login process. In order to automate this process, the used device will need to be assigned to a store.
Assigning a device to a store
Follow one of the guides below to assign a device to a store, based on how the Associate App is set up in your business. Assigned devices will automatically change the store assignment of the associate who uses the device to log into the app.
Setting up automatic assignment using an MDM
​
To set up automatic store assignment for associates using an MDM application:
Follow the steps in this
guide
to set up the MDM application.
Ensure that you have configured
storeId
as a parameter in your
Managed App Configuration
.
Important
The
storeId
is the internal identifier of a store entity within the NewStore platform. The
storeId
can be viewed in NOM >
Locations
>
YOUR_STORE_NAME
.
An example has been displayed here:
If a wrong
storeId
is specified, the associate can still log in, but the automatic store assignment does not work.
Most MDM applications allow programmatically setting up variables to be passed into the
Managed App Configuration
. For example,
Extension attributes
can be set in
Jamf
.
Setting up automatic assignment using a QR code
​
To set up the automatic store assignment using a QR code:
Install the application using
Testflight
or distribute the application using an MDM application without setting up a
Managed App Configuration
.
Bootstrap the installed Associate App versions.
Create and scan a QR code with this URL or enter the URL in the Safari Browser of your device:
com.newstore.associate-one://bootstrap?live={tenant}&test={tenant-staging}&storeId={store-id}
Important
Once the application is uninstalled from the device, any information provided during the bootstrap process is also removed.
The
storeId
(and therefore automatic assignment for the associate) is removed when switching between
Test mode
and Live mode.
