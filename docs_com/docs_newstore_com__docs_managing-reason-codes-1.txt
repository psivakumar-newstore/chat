Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Modify reason codes permission.
Important
Returns, refund or appeasements, order cancelations or item swaps are only available as reason types when you have created at least one related reason code.
The reason codes you create are displayed to users when they process different order transactions.
Return reasons are displayed to associates when processing returns in NewStore Associate App.
Refund (appeasement) reasons, cancelation reasons and swap reasons are displayed to Omnichannel Manager users when processing refunds or appeasements, cancelations and swaps.
Reasons are displayed in the language to which the user's app is set. If no translations exist for the language, reasons are displayed in English.
When viewing reason codes in NOM, you can search for a code, or filter the list of reason codes by
Reason type
, such as
Returns
or
Refunds
.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable reason codes, see
Enabling reason codes.
Creating reason codes
Notes
Inform your integration team when you create or update reason codes to ensure that they are mapped accurately to any external systems that use them.
To create reason codes:
Go to
Settings
>
Reason Codes
and click
Add New Reason Code
.
In the
Create Reason Code
screen that appears, specify the following:
In
Reason Type
, specify the reason for the specific reason code. Possible values include:
Returns
,
Cancelations
,
Refunds
, and
Swaps
.
In
Code
, specify a unique number of up to 3 digits. For example:
1
,
2
,
450
.
In
Reason
, enter the reason related to the code. This is the default reason associated with the code and is mandatory. The default language for a reason for the code is
English
.
Example:
Damaged item
or
Incorrect product or size ordered
.
To add a translated version of the default reason, select the preferred languages you want to translate the reason to from the
Add/Remove translation
drop-down menu.
For every language you select, you must manually type in the translation in the respective field. When an associate uses the app in the specific language (such as in
German
), the translated version of the
reason
is displayed in the app.
Click
Save
.
The page displays the default code, the language(s) the reason for the code is being translated to, the time when you created or last modified the code, and your username.
Editing reason codes
The code for a reason cannot be edited. You can only edit the reason description. To edit the code for a specific reason, delete the reason code and create a new one instead. See
Deleting reason codes
.
Note
Inform your integration team when you create or update reason codes to ensure that the codes are mapped accurately to any external systems that use them.
To edit the reason for a code:
Click
Edit
for the reason you want to edit.
Edit the default reason and its translation(s). The code and the associated type of return cannot be updated.
Click
Save
. The default reason and its translation(s) are saved.
The page displays the updated reasons, the language(s) the reason for the code is being translated to, the time when you updated the code, and your username.
Deleting reason codes
If you made a mistake in the
Code
when you created the reason code, you cannot edit the code. Delete the reason code and create a new reason code. Deleting a reason code has no impact on orders that are related to this reason code.
To delete a reason code:
Click
Edit
for the code you want to delete.
To delete the code and the reasons, click
Delete
.
Verify that you're deleting the correct code and click
Confirm
to confirm the deletion.
The reason code is removed. The deleted reason code is not displayed in NOM or Associate App.
