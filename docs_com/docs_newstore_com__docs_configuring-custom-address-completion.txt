Associate App uses
Apple MapKit
by default to complete addresses when creating or updating customer profiles or during shipment for endless aisle orders.
However, in certain countries,
Apple MapKit
does not provide accurate addresses for certain countries. For such situations, you can use a custom solution to control how to process addresses in the correct format. Using this custom solution allows you to use the address provider of your choice, such as
AWS locations
,
Google Maps
, and others.
Setting up custom address completion
To display custom address completion information in Associate App, set up a lambda function for NewStore to fetch the correct addresses.
Configure the lambda function to support the
GET
method, enabling Associate App to send requests with specific query parameters. The lambda function requires the following parameters to process requests from Associate App:
query: string
The address search query. For example, street name and house number
context: string
Additional details of the address. For example, postal code and city
lang: string
The client locale and language
Here is an example of what the
GET
request should look like:
<lambda URL>?query=745%20Atlantic%20Ave&context=Boston%2C%20MA%2C%20United%20States&lang=en-us
The response of the lambda must match the format of the payload described here:
interface FullAddress {
  name: string // Displayed as Address1 field in the address form in the app
  zip: string
  city: string
  cityDistrict: string
  country: string
  countryCode: string
  administrativeArea: string // Displayed as State field in the address form in the app
  streetName: string
  houseNumber: string
}
For an example of the lambda function payload to integrate custom address providers with Associate App, see the
integration guide
.
Enabling custom address completion
To enable associates to view address completion in the app from address providers of your choice, enable this feature:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
customizations
>
address_completion
, specify the lambda URL you have configured in the previous section or the one provided by NewStore (
https://{tenant}.p.newstore.net/retail-org/address-completions/addresses
).
Note
Apple Mapkit
for address completion is enabled by default. You only need to enable this feature to ensure addresses are retrieved from your preferred address provider other than
Apple Mapkit
.
Apple Mapkit
uses the search service provided by Apple. The custom implementation provided by NewStore uses AWS location service with
HERE Technologies
as a provider.
