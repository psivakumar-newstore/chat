and

before proceeding with this module.
Before activating
Endless aisle
, ensure the following essential configurations are complete:
Carrier setup
Service level
definition
Easypost adapter integration (if applicable)
Routing configuration for DC/Store locations
Accurate inventory data for ordered products
Due to the nature of Endless Aisle orders, cash payments cannot be accepted as there will not be any way to refund the money if there is any cancellation happening to the order. To accommodate this, we will set up the “External Payment” configuration, allowing customers to complete their orders using alternative payment methods.
Configuration process
In the Payment options configuration, fetch the payment options using
Get payments config API
and using the payload add
non_integrated
as a payment option and update the config using the
Update payments config API
.
These critical configurations were previously discussed in earlier modules, laying the groundwork for a seamless Endless Aisle experience.
With the necessary configurations complete, you can now activate the Endless Aisle feature by simply switching on the corresponding toggle in the Associate App configuration settings.
