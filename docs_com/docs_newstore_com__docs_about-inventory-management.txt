NewStore Omnichannel Cloud allows you to manage inventory operations and stock locations using NewStore Associate App. You can also enable a store in your business to use NewStore as
inventory master
, instead of an ERP, to manage inventory-related operations and data.
If you use NewStore as inventory master for a store, these inventory operations rely on stock locations that help you manage salable and unsalable stock.
Integration-wise, once an inventory transaction is completed, an event is sent out to third party systems in your business via NewStore Event Stream. See
Syncing inventory transactions using the Event stream
.
Inventory receiving
The inventory receiving process allows associates to receive inventory from a DC or another store to their store.
To identify this process, NewStore uses either an
ASN
as an electronic reference on the app, or a manually typed in reference number for a
purchase order
or a shipment.
To receive inventory in your store using NewStore Associate App, see
Receiving inventory
.
Inventory transfers
The inventory transfer process allows associates to transfer inventory from their store to another store or DC in your business. Inventory transfers help stores fulfill endless aisle orders or in-store purchases.
To request the transfer, a
transfer order
is provided by the ERP. The transferred inventory is received against an
ASN
that NewStore Omnichannel Cloud creates for the receiving store.
To transfer inventory using NewStore Associate App, see
Transferring inventory
.
Inventory adjustments
The inventory adjustment process allows associates to adjust
stock on hand
in their store.
To adjust inventory in your store using NewStore Associate App, see
Adjusting inventory
.
Cycle counts
The cycle counting process helps increase the accuracy of stock on hand. Associates can use NewStore Associate App to work on count tasks scheduled for specific products and submit the product count.
To count inventory in your store using NewStore Associate App, see
Cycle count inventory
.
Scheduling and performing full counts
The full count process helps retailers meet regulatory requirements and ensure accurate financial reporting. This process is vital for verifying inventory levels in financial statements, which directly influences profitability and tax calculations. Additionally, full counts act as a periodic "reset" to correct any discrepancies in inventory records.

schedule full counts in Omnichannel Manager
and
perform counts in the store using Associate App
