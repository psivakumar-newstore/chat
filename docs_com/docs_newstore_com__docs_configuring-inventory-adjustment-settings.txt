Maintain these settings to control how inventory adjustments work for a retailer on NewStore inventory management.
Enabling inventory adjustments
To enable inventory adjustments on Associate App:
Use this
configuration
method.
Specify the store IDs or a wild card
*
value for the

property.
Configuring manual quantity updates

To disable manual quantity updates across stores and DCs in your business:
For Associate App, use this
configuration
method.
Specify the value for the
allow_adjustments_manual_quantity_editing
property as

.
Managing adjustment reasons
You can update or deactivate adjustment reasons configured for your business.
Updating adjustment reasons
You can choose to update the reasons for
adjusting inventory
in stores across your business. To view the adjustment reasons that have already been configured, use the
List adjustment reasons
method.
To update an adjustment reason:
Use the
Update adjustment reason
method.
Specify the updated values for the
subtype
and
type
properties.
For example, you can specify an updated adjustment reasons and specify the
type

.
When you update an adjustment reason, associates can start using the updated reason to adjust inventory in the store via NewStore Associate App.
If associates have used the adjustment reason before you updated it, the previous reason will still be displayed in the list of inventory adjustments or transactions that are associated with it.
Deactivating adjustment reasons
When you create reasons to
adjust inventory
for your business, they are activated in the platform by default. However, if you do not want associates to use a specific adjustment reason to adjust inventory in the store using NewStore Associate App, you can deactivate it.
Note
Deactivating an adjustment reason does not delete it from the platform.
If associates have used the adjustment reason before you deactivated it, the reason will still be displayed in the list of inventory adjustments or transactions that are associated with it.
To deactivate an adjustment reason:
Use the
Update adjustment reason
method.
Specify the value for the
is_activated
property as
false
.
