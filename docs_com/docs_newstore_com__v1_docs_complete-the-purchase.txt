Learn how you can manage order approvals for certain orders and complete the purchase workflow for the customer.
Managing order approvals
Based on the rules configured for your business in NewStore, certain kinds of orders may require approval. For example, if you apply a discount to the order, if the order is paid for in cash, or if you had to enter the credit card details manually.
Note
For a seamless checkout experience, we recommend that you know the approval rules configured for your business in NewStore.
If you are using NewStore Associate App v1.2.0 or earlier versions, any associate assigned to the same store can approve an order.
If you are using NewStore Associate App v1.3.0 or later, only store managers or certain associates with the relevant permissions can approve the order.
Important
For coupons or promotions applied automatically to orders in the app, manager approval rules do not apply.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To assign the required permissions for approving orders to store associates, see
Permissions for NewStore Associate App
. For more information on approval rules configured for your business, see
Configuring manager approval rules
.
Getting approvals for orders
Note
No notifications are sent to other associates or your manager alerting them that you need approval for an order. Ensure that you know which associates can approve orders in the store, for faster checkouts.
To get your order approved, ask the approver to scan the QR code that is displayed on your app. When they approve the order on their app, you can continue with the workflow and complete the purchase.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
Only associates assigned to the same store, and with the required permissions, can approve your order. For more information, see
Permissions for NewStore Associate App
.
Approving orders
To approve an order:
Scan the QR code displayed on the app of the associate processing the order. The reasons for order approval are displayed.
Tap
Approve
. Your name and email are recorded in the approver details when orders are exported in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. See the
Approver Name
and
Approver Email
fields in
CSV columns in the order export
.
If you tap
Cancel
, the associate cannot proceed with the purchase.
Completing the purchase
When the payment transaction is complete you can either print the receipt or email the receipt to the customer.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
(Optional)
If enabled for your business, you can print gift receipts for the customer, if a gift is part of the order. See
Printing gift receipts
.
To send the sales receipt to the customer's email address, tap
Email Receipt
. Enter an email address. If the customer doesn't have a profile in NewStore, a new customer profile is created using the email address you entered. If the customer already has a profile, the receipt is sent to the email address you added. No new profile is created using this email address.
Additionally, if a customer has a prior purchase and they have misplaced or lost their original sales receipt, the store associate can resend the original sales receipt to the email address that was used for the original purchase. Associates can resend the sales receipt within the customer profile by selecting the Activity tab and then
finding the specific order
for which the customer would like the sales receipt.
Note
If the email address provided as part of the original purchase was incorrect, the option to send the sales receipt to email will use the same email address that was used on the original purchase. It is recommended to resend receipts to the customer using NewStore Omnichannel Manager instead of the Associate App.
To print the receipt for the customer, tap
Print Receipt
.
If you have only one printing station in the store, the printing job starts immediately when you tap
Print Receipt
. If you have more than one printing station, a countdown appears. The printing job starts when the countdown reaches
0
. To print immediately, tap the countdown itself.
Use this countdown to change the printing station, if needed.
Note
Selecting a new printing station does not change the default printing station. See
Setting your default printing station
.
Tap
Done
to finish the checkout process. The purchase is complete and is displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. For more information, see
Omnichannel Manager
.
(Optional)
Printing fiscal receipts
To print receipts to comply with hardware
fiscalization
requirements in your store, such as for stores operating in Italy or Poland:
Add a fiscal printer to your store. See
(Optional) Setting up a fiscal printer
.
After the payment transaction is complete for the order, tap
Submit Order
.
NewStore Associate App automatically prints a receipt using the
fiscal printer
in the store.
Important
Because Associate App communicates with the fiscal printer during the order placement process to print a fiscal receipt, ensure that it remains in the foreground and that the iPhone stays unlocked.
Important
Ensure that a
Z-Daily Report
has been generated and printed via NewStore Associate App at the end of each applicable period for the store. Otherwise, printing sales receipts via a fiscal printer will fail the next day. To view the supported time period for each type of fiscal report in the app, see
(Optional) Printing fiscal reports
.
(Optional)
Printing fiscal reports
If your business operates in a country where hardware
fiscalization
regulations apply, such as in Italy or Poland, you must print fiscal reports at a specified frequency. For example, at the end of each day.
To print documents to comply with
fiscalization
requirements in your store:
Add a fiscal printer to your store. Â see
(Optional) Setting up a fiscal printer
.
Tap
>
Fiscal Reports
.
Print one of these fiscal reports for the store:
X-Daily Report
: An
X-Daily Report
, or a flash summary report includes all transactions done in the time period from when the last
Z-Daily Report
was generated until the time the
X-Daily Report
was invoked.
To print the report, tap
X-Report
>
Daily Report
>
Print
.
Z-Daily Report
: A
Z-Daily Report
is generated at the end of each business day at the store, and includes a detailed log of all transactions done in the store for the day.
To print the report, tap
Z-Report
>
Daily Report
>
Print
.
Z-Monthly Report
: A
Z-Monthly Report
is generated at the end of each month at the store, and includes a detailed log of all transactions done in the store for the month.
To print the report, tap
Z-Report
>
Monthly Report
>
Print
.
(Optional)
Resolving fiscalization errors
If you are operating in a store in Sweden,
fiscal regulations
in the country require the store to meet certain requirements. One of these is to log transactions made in the store via a control unit.
If the control unit is unavailable or does not work, an error message with the following text is displayed when you try to submit the order after payment is complete:
Order placement failed due to fiscalization error. Retry or contact support for assistance.
You can try to submit the order again by tapping
Submit Order
. If the order fails again, contact the
support team
.
Any orders that cannot be placed due to errors with the control unit or other fiscalization errors are logged in the fiscal reports as voided transactions. See
Viewing fiscal reports
.
Important
When fiscalization errors occur, it is possible that the payment or refund may have been processed, even if the order or return was not placed. Ensure that any necessary corrections are made to avoid discrepancies later.

Editing shipping information in the grace period
.
Note
You can access only the last
sale
that you made, via
Last Checkout
. If your last cart was a return, tap
, choose the customer and update the customer information. You can also tap
Activity
to reprint the sales receipt or return receipt.
Accessing recent transactions
Store associates can instantly access the last 20 transactions, including both sales and returns, made on their device. To view the recent transactions processed on a specific device, go to the empty
Cart
screen and tap
Recent Transactions
. Alternatively, navigate to the
More
screen and select
Recent Transactions
.
The last 20 transactions processed by your user account on this device is displayed to you.
