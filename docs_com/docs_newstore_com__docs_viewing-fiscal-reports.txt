Fiscal reports in NewStore Omnichannel Manager include daily summary reports and a downloadable electronic transaction journal. These reports help you to stay compliant with the
fiscal regulations
applicable to the countries that your stores operate in. Tax auditors can request for these reports as part of unannounced audits to check compliance, and compare the reports against available transaction details in the POS and control unit.
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the View fiscal reports permission.

Currently, fiscal reports are only available for stores operating in Sweden and Norway.
The
Daily Report
is generated at the end of each business day for the store.
