Pre-requisites
To set up an identity management application to manage authentication for NewStore apps, ensure that you have access to:
Omnichannel Manager
Google Workspace admin console
Important
To enable users from your corporate directory to be able to use the NewStore applications, you have to create users, assign them to a store, and assign relevant roles in NewStore.
Setting up Google Workspace with NewStore
This process involves working with Google Workspace and Omnichannel Manager in tandem. Ensure you have access to both before you proceed.
Log into your Google Workspace and verify that every user has admin permissions.
Go to the
Admin
app.
In the
Google Admin
console, go to
Home > Apps > Web and mobile apps
.
Click
Add App
and select
Add custom SAML app
from the drop-down menu.
In the
App details
screen that appears, enter a name for this new app that is related to the NewStore environment name. For example,
NewStore Platform Staging
.
(Optional)
Choose an icon for the new app.
Click
Continue
.
In the
Option 1: Download IdP metadata
screen that appears, click the
DOWNLOAD METADATA
button and save the XML file locally on your computer.
Click
Continue

Open
Omnichannel Manager
in a new tab.
Click
Settings
>
Users & Roles

.
Click
Configure Single Sign-On
.
Select Vendor
GOOGLE

Upload the XML file with IdP metadata from Step 7.

Switch back to the
Google Workspace
tab.

Enabling groups and users
Go to the
User access
section in the
NewStore Platform Staging
app.
Enable the app for the group or number of users that must be allowed to log into the specific NewStore environment.
Use the following options:
Allow access to everyone
Allow access based on membership in a Group
Allow access based on membership in an Organizational Unit
After you have decided about the groups or number of users, select them and activate the service for them.
Note
Google refers to the
App
as a
service
in this scenario.
Ensure that
User access
is not to set to
OFF for everyone
