Store-specific shipping options
Retailers can now configure available shipping options per store including:
shipping options
associated shipping costs
estimated delivery times and cut-off hours
All configurations have to be requested in advance and are done by NewStore.
Hold and review orders instead of auto-canceling them
When a problem is encountered during order processing (out of stock, failed payment authorization, timeout of an external service), the order is no longer automatically canceled. It is put into a holding state (called
Conflict
).
A notification about the conflicted order is sent to NewStore to fix the order or, if fixing is not possible, cancel it manually.
See
Order status
.

Each retailer can now import several catalogs.

Custom Order Attributes
Retailers can now populate additional custom attributes during checkout and also retrieve the custom attributes as part of order item information.

Shops
Shops allow customers to manage multiple catalogs using the same data set (Category, Products, Language, Price and Currency):
A retailer can create multiple shops with different data sets to address different channels, brands or countries.
A shop is created as part of the data import from a traditional e-commerce system.
Inventory is handled separately from the catalog and shop concept.
Safety stock for inventory items
Safety stocks prevent overselling and resulting order cancellations by setting aside a small quantity of each item of a store.
Zero-value orders
Orders with a zero cost can now be processed, which includes:
Enabling the return of a zero-cost item and generating a refund note.
Note
This feature is available for domestic orders only.
