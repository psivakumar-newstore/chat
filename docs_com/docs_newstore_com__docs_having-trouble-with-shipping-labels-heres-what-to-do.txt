Sometimes, shipping label issues can pop up for different reasons. In this guide, we’ll focus on issues related to temporary carrier downtimes and how to get them sorted out quickly.
NewStore uses EasyPost to handle different shipping carriers like FedEx or UPS, since each one has its own system for managing labels. If you’re not using your own shipping setup, we recommend subscribing to the EasyPost status page here: EasyPost Status Page.
This way, you’ll be notified if there’s a problem with any of the carriers. For example, FedEx doesn’t have its own status page, so EasyPost keeps you updated.
For larger issues that might affect more than one carrier, you can also check our NewStore status page here: NewStore Status Page.
Common Issue: Error When Trying to Print a Shipping Label
If you try to print a shipping label and see an error like "Something Went Wrong", follow these steps to get it fixed:
Solution 1: For Fulfilling Orders
If you’re fulfilling an
Order
and get a label error, and the "Retry" button isn’t working, here’s what to do:
Contact NewStore Support
with the order number.
Our team can help by re-booking the shipping label directly with the carrier. Once the carrier issue is fixed, the label should go through.
Solution 2: For
Transfer
Orders
If you're processing a
Transfer order
(moving
Inventory
from one place to another) and run into the same label error, the process is a bit different:
Reach out to
NewStore Support
and provide the details of the transfer order.
In some cases, our Engineering team may need to step in, and it could take a bit longer to resolve.
You also have the option to ask Support to close the current transfer order and create a new one for the remaining items.
Best Practices to Avoid Future Issues
For long-term peace of mind, we recommend setting up a
backup shipping carrier
. This means that if one carrier has an issue, you’ll have another option available.
To learn more about setting up a backup carrier, check out this guide:

Exciting Update:
We’re working on a feature that will make re-trying labels easier, without needing to contact Support. Keep an eye out for this improvement coming soon!
By following these steps, you’ll be back on track with your shipping labels in no time! And remember, we’re always here to help if you need further assistance.
