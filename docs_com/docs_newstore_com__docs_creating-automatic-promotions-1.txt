Buy X Get Y promotion example
When you create a BXGY promotion in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, the discount will not be applied directly to only one item in the order. The promotion is distributed across the item that you buy and the item that is eligible for the discount. This allows you to process a return for any of the items that were part of a BXGY promotion, and provide a refund to the customer.
For example, you create a promotion for
Item A ($100)
and
Item B ($50)
, where the customer buys
Item A
and gets a
100% discount ($50 discount)
on
Item B
.
In this scenario, the discount is applied to both items and not just to
Item B
.
To calculate the discount for each item, NewStore uses this ratio:
ratio = discount/(price of Item A + price of Item B)
In this example, the ratio is
50/150 = 0.33
.
NewStore then multiplies the ratio with the original price of each item. In this example, the discount for each item is calculated as:
Discount on
Item A
:
0.33 * $100 = $33.4
Discount on
Item B
:
0.33 * $50 = $16.6
The total discount is computed as
$50
for the BXGY promotion.
If the customer wants to returns an item, the refund will be processed based on the discounted price of the item.
Creating a promotion bundle
You can create an automatic promotion where you can specify a specific price or a percentage discount for a set of products that will be sold together.
Currently, NewStore allows you to create these types of promotion bundles for customers:
Single item bundles
: Buy 2 items of the same type priced at $500 each, and get them both for for a $800 fixed amount.
Multiple item bundles
: Buy 1 item of product A and 1 or more items of product B (a total of $1200) and get them all for a $900 fixed amount instead.
A specific price point bundle
: Buy 3 items of the same price (such as  $500 each) and get all of them for a fixed amount of $1200 instead, which indicates that each item was discounted to $400 each.
Multiple price point bundles
: Buy 3 items of mixed pricing (such as $500, $850, and $750) and get all of them for a fixed amount of $1800 instead of the original total price of $2100, or a discount of 25% on the original total price.
Important
These limitations apply when using promotion bundles for your products:
Promotion bundles cannot be combined with other promotions for items.
For promotions applies to a cart or the whole order, promotion bundles cannot be combined with other promotions, like on items that are part of the bundle.
Price point
promotion bundles cannot be combined with additional promotions or coupons.
If you need to offer additional discounts, specify them manually for the item or the order.

Calculating best price for exclusive promotions
When calculating the best price for customers (based on the value of the cart), NewStore separates coupons into exclusive and non-exclusive ones, similar to automatic promotions. If there are multiple exclusive coupons, NewStore identifies the one that offers the maximum savings for the customer.
If there are no exclusive promotions or coupons, NewStore applies all non-exclusive promotions and coupons to the cart.
If there are exclusive promotions or coupons, NewStore determines which scenario offers the most savings for the customer:
Using the exclusive promotion,
Using the exclusive coupon, or
Using non-exclusive promotions and coupons
NewStore then applies the most beneficial scenario to the cart. A warning is also added to any coupons that were not applied due to the application of an exclusive promotion or discount.

Rounding and prorating
When adjusting prices, NewStore rounds them based on the currency. For instance, USD prices are rounded to 2 decimals, while JPY prices are rounded to the nearest whole number.
For discounts that are prorated on the items, any extra cents from rounding are distributed among the discounted items.
For example, if there's a
10€
discount on 3 items of equal price, each item gets a discount of
3.33€
, rounded to
3.34€
for the first item and
3.33€
for the remaining 2 items.
Discounts, on the other hand, are rounded individually.
For example if an item of price
17.90€
gets a
15%
discount, that will be calculated as
2.685€
and rounded up to
2.69€
.
The additional
0.005€
that was added to reach an exact value will not be compensated for other discounts applied on the item.
