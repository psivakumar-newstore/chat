method will no longer return results for cash & carry orders. This change was already announced in the API documentation and the implementation of this change will take place through April and May.
March 2025
Clienteling Opt-In Status Tracking Webhook
We have added
clienteling.optin_changed
as a trackable event using
NewStore Webhooks
. This will allow retailers to stay up to date on Clienteling opt-in changes their customers are making including those that have been sent an invite, those that have accepted an invite, and those that have opted out altogether. More information on how the opt-in status behaves can be
found here in our feature level documentation
.
January 2025
New APIs​
Cart API
The Cart API
provides tools to manage the cart through individual, isolated operations, to allow a more flexible and customizable cart creation experience. It allows integrators to update or modify carts outside the Associate App. Currently, the following operations are available:
Show cart
Add product
Update product
Attach add-on to a product
Delete product
We plan to extend these capabilities in the future.

provides powerful tools for creating and managing customer segments, which can be used to tailor marketing and selling efforts more effectively.
Key functionalities include the ability to create store-specific customer segments using tags based on specific criteria, update segment definitions, and retrieve details about existing segments.
Associate App now features an
Outreach List
tab for the
Clienteling
screen, allowing associates to leverage customer segments via this API.

A new property (

)
jurisdiction_in_tax_name_enabled
has now been introduced to the
vertex
payload under the
taxes configuration API
, which enables retailers to add the name of the jurisdiction in the tax line of receipts.
For example:
Sales and Use Tax - ALABAMA
can be specified as the value for this property, which describes the tax imposed by the state of
Alabama
.

Associate App configuration API
Release date
: 22 July, 2024
The
feature toggle
reason_codes_enabled
is not used for newer Associate App versions, and the
Cart management configuration option
priceOverride
is not used for newer Associate App versions.
If you are on Associate App v1.52.0 or later, reason codes are enabled by default.
You can enable both
item level manual discounts
and
price override
, when on Associate App v1.52.0 or later, by specifying
itemDiscount
as a value within the
cart_management
or
cart_management_v2
property in the
Update Associate App configuration method
.
For Associate App v1.52.0 or later, the
cart_management_v2
property has
no impact
on price overrides. This property is only applicable if you are on Associate App v1.50.0 or v1.51.0. See
Configuring price overrides for items (v1.50.0 and v1.51.0)
as an example.
The reference of the new configuration can be found

for manual discounts and
here
for price overrides.
June 2024
Updates to existing APIs
App Extension API
Release date
: 24 June, 2024
Added two new methods,
getProductConfiguration
and
updateProductConfiguration(configuration)
, for Advanced App Extension update product configuration actions. These methods update the product configuration with the new attribute values provided in the configuration object. See the
API documentation
.
Order information retrieval API
Release date
: 17 June, 2024
You can now use the
Order information retrieval API
to retrieve information related to orders being processed in the NewStore platform or via an external OMS.
Previously, this method was part of
Customer API v0
but has now been separated out as a standalone resource.
The
Order history for customers
method now also supports retrieving the history also for orders originating from NewStore OMS. To use this new functionality, provide a new
Accept
header in the HTTP request. See the
API documentation
.
April 2024
Updates to existing APIs
Associate App configuration API
Removal of release toggle
new_gift_card_overview
As the New Gift Card overview is available for all retailers by default, the Associate App does not use the release toggle
new_gift_card_overview
.
The release toggle
new_gift_card_overview
will be removed from the
Associate App configuration API
on April 22, 2024.
Customer Profile Updates API
The maximum length requirement on the
consumer_id
property has been removed. This allows you to update customer profiles for orders that use PII tokens.
Fulfillment Request API
The Fulfillment Request API now supports a new rejection reason called rescinded, allowing retailers to reject items in a fulfillment request and reroute them without any changes to availability.
Edge cases:
If your organization's settings allow it (i.e.
reroute_to_rejected_fulfillment_nodes
is set to
true
), rejected fulfillment nodes will be downgraded in priority during the routing process. Otherwise, rejected fulfillment nodes will be ignored during future routing attempts (i.e. if
reroute_to_rejected_fulfillment_nodes
is set to
false
).
If all fulfillment nodes are rejected and you don't want to reroute to these nodes, the rejected items will be put on hold.
November 2023
New APIs
EasyPost Adapter Configuration API
Now you can configure the EasyPost adapter using the EasyPost Adapter Configuration API. This formerly private API is now publicly available with a new authentication flow.
As a reminder, the EasyPost adapter is maintained by NewStore as an implementation of the
shipping provider webhook specification
. Until now, integrators were not able to configure the adapter themselves and had to rely on NewStore Support or the engineering team due to custom authentication. This problem is addressed now.
Read more details about the
EasyPost Adapter Configuration API
.
September 2023
Updates to existing APIs
Customer v0 and v1 APIs
Because of a lack of usage in active integrations, NewStore decided to sunset the following methods:
Customer API v0
Find product
Customer API v1
Search products
They will stop working on September 15, 2023. Retailers can use the Customer API v0
List products
as an alternative.
Users API
Earlier, retailers performed user management via Omnichannel Manager. With this new User management API, you can configure and manage your users with a single API.
For more information, see the API documentation in our
Developer Portal
.
August 2023
New APIs
Customer profile API v2
Retailers can now use the new
Customer Profile API v2
to create and manage customers in their business. For more information, see the

Migrating from v1 to v2
Important
The new API is now available in our new
Developer Portal
and not the

(which contains the documentation for the legacy customer profile APIs).
Taxes Integration API
Retailers can now use the
Taxes Integration API
to create or retrieve tax transactions. Tax transactions contain detailed information about tax calculations, including tax exemption information and taxes applied to an order.
For more information, see the guide on
retrieving tax information
.
New fulfillment configuration APIs
You can now use 2 new APIs, the
Routing rule set
API and
Service levels
API to set up your fulfillment configuration, without having to use the
legacy fulfillment configuration API
for anything other than provider rates and their priority.
For more information on how to use these APIs to set up your fulfillment configuration (such as service levels and routes), see the
tutorial
.
July 2023
Updates to existing APIs

Custom Tax Provider Setup Guide
.
April 2023
Updates to existing APIs
Coupons API
The
Coupons API
now allows coupons to be restricted for specific customers, using the customer ID. This can be used to provide special discounts to employees or privilege club members or for specific groups such as charity organizations.
A
consumers
array was added to the request payload, similar to the existing
stores
property, in which you can add the list of customer IDs that can use the discount coupon.
When
creating a coupon
, now you can enable or disable the local timezone for the promotions using the
localizedTimezone
property, which was added to the request payload.
March 2023
Event Stream observability API
Retailers can now use the
Event Stream Observability API
to monitor existing Event Stream webhook and S3 integrations with NewStore.
Note
You can also use the
Tools
section in Omnichannel Manager to monitor Event Stream event logs. See
Montoring Event Stream logs
.
Updates to existing APIs
Store-specific promotions
Retailers can now use the property
stores
with the APIs to
Create a Promotion
and
Create a Coupon
to select specific stores where certain promotions or coupons will be available.
February 2023
New APIs
Customer Profile API v1
Retailers can now use the
Customer Profile API v1
to manage the customer profile operations.
Note
The
Customer Profile API v0
will be deprecated as of December 01, 2023 and NewStore has communicated the migration plan to the retailers using this API. We recommend that all new integrations use the latest
Customer Profile API v1
.
Updates to existing APIs
Search by Coupon name and/or code
The
Get coupons
method has been updated to support searching for coupons by name and/or coupon code. The retrieved results are paginated.
Legacy Coupons API
The deprecation of the legacy Coupons API was
extended
from March 31, 2023 to
June 15, 2023
. We recommend that you migrate to the new coupons framework as soon as possible.
January 2023
New APIs
Capacity-based routing API
Retailers can now specify capacity-based routing limits for orders to be fulfilled by stores, allowing stores to not be overwhelmed with orders and missing delivery expectations.
This feature can be enabled using the
store capacity configuration API
.
Use the
Capacity-based Routing
API to set up and manage capacity-based routing in your stores. For more information, see
Managing capacity-based routing for stores
.
A typical use case for enabling store capacity routing could be that you would like to only route fulfillment orders to stores during open hours only for stores in Japan, at a maximum of 8 orders per day.
In this example, we set up the capacity-based routing feature for all stores in Japan and the US. Using store names that have a common denominator by area, will also allow you to take advantage of wildcards in the store name when setting up capacity-based routing for stores.
Sample payload
curl -i \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
         -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
         -XPOST "${URL}/v0/store_capacity" \
         -d'
    {
      "policy": {
        "JP-*": {
          "limit": 8,
          "hours": {
            "*": [23, 11],
            "saturday": null,
            "sunday": null
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "US-*": {
          "limit": 8,
          "hours": {
            "*": [8, 20],
            "saturday": null,
            "sunday": null
          }
        }
      }
    }'
