NewStore supports selling through multiple channels to allow a customer to interact and engage with a retailer or brand. Omnichannel services allow retailers to sell items even if stock is not available at the location where the customer(s) is at, such as a specific store.
NewStore offers the following omnichannel services via Associate App and Omnichannel Manager:
Fulfillment
- Allowing orders placed in the store or online to be fulfilled by any location, based on routing rules and fulfillment configuration set up for your business.
BOPIS
-
Buy online and pickup in store
allows customers to buy items online, but choose to pick these items from a store or from an agreed upon location.
BORIS
-
Buy online return in store
allows customers to buy items online, but choose to return these items at a store.
Endless
aisle
- Allows a customer to access a product that is currently out-of-stock in the store, but available elsewhere in your supply chain (such as a different store or warehouse).
The customer can then buy the product and have it delivered to them at an agreed upon location (home, office, or scheduled for pickup at a store).
Mixed
cart
- Associate App allows carts to contain item(s) available in the store where the order is placed, as well as item(s) available in a different store or warehouse.
These remote items can then be shipped to the customer while the item(s) available in the store can be picked up by the customer after checking out and payment.
