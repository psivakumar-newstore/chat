Employee creation
An employee or associate is created in the NewStore platform manually via NewStore Omnichannel Manager, when an administrator in your business
creates a user
and assigns roles and permissions. See
Managing users and roles
.
The
employee.created
event is emitted.
Note
The event payload does not contain the roles and permissions assigned to the employee or associate. To verify which roles or permissions have been assigned to the associate, see
Managing users and roles
Employee modification
Once an employee is created, details associated with the employee can be modified via NewStore Omnichannel Manager. See
Managing users and roles
. You can:
Deactivate or delete employee accounts.
Assign roles or permissions via NewStore Omnichannel Manager for access to NewStore apps. See
Default roles and permissions
.
When details associated with an employee is updated, the
employee.updated
event is emitted.
