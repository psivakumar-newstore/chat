Runners help you move products from the stockroom to the sales floor, to a sales associate who is serving a shopper or to refill the sales floor.
You can benefit from using the Runner when you display multiple units of SKUs of a specific product style on the sales floor, and shoppers can pick the products and purchase without assistance. You can then use the Runner to submit
Replenishment
requests to replenish the purchased products on the sales floor.
On the other hand, if you display only 1 SKU of a specific product style on the sales floor, then you can use the Runner to submit
Try On
requests, as an associate will need to help the shopper enable the purchase.
Runners in a retail store are responsible for delivering products to the sales floor fast, ensuring a smooth shopping experience for customers and an increase in conversion.
Prerequisites
Note
The
Runner
functionality is supported from Associate App v1.36.0.
You can configure the Runner functionality using the
Associate App Configuration API
.
To enable the Runner functionality, set
release_toggles
>
runner_enabled
to
true
.
Configuring the push notifications for runners
If you want to be notified about the updates on the runner requests, configure the push notification settings before starting to use runners.
To enable push notifications, use the
Associate App Configuration API
to set
release_toggles
>
push_notifications
to
true
.
Login to NewStore Associate App.
Tap
Settings > Notification Settings > Runner Notifications
.
Enable
New Task Submitted
to be notified when an associate submits a new task.
Enable
Task Accepted
to be notified when an associate accepts a new task.
Enable
Task Completed
to be notified when your task is marked as complete.
Enable
Product Exception
to be notified when a product is not available.
Enable
Note Added
to be notified when a new note is added by the Runner or sales associate.
The notification setting for this feature is turned on by default.
On this screen, you can enable or disable the runner notifications depending on your role. For example, stockroom associates who run the products to the sales floor after a runner request is created should turn on the notifications for the new tasks submitted. However, the sales associate who submitted the runner request would be interested to receive notifications when the request is accepted or completed, and when a product is unavailable.
Note
The runner push notifications work along with the iOS notification settings and the users will be notified in or outside Associate App based on their device notification configurations.
Using the Runner in Associate App
As a sales associate and a runner, you can manage runner tasks in Associate App.
Adding runner tasks
To add a runner task:
You can scan or type product's identifying code or search the product from the catalog.
You can check the stock on hand and shipping availability.
To decide to place an endless aisle order, if there is no stock on hand, or
To decide to request the products from the stock room, if there is stock on hand
When there is stock on hand, you can request the product by tapping
Add to Runner
option on the
Product Details
page in Associate App. The default quantity that appears is
1
and you can change it, if needed. You can also request for multiple products to be added to the runner request.
Tap
More
or the side menu and go to
Runner
to see a runner task with the products that you added now.
Select the type as
Try On
or
Replenishment
. Runners will bring the products to the sales associate for
Try On
and will refill the racks and shelves for Replenishment.
Change the quantity, if needed.
Add a note, if needed.
Submit the runner task.
Fulfilling runner tasks
To fulfill a runner task:
Access the Runner from the
More
or side menu on the right.
The Runner menu shows the runner tasks in an ascending order with the following information:
Type of the request,
Try On
or
Replenishment
Name of the sales associate who placed the request
Time of the request
Status of the request (
Pending
or
In Progress
)
A Runner can select a task and tap to view its details. The requested products are listed, displaying:
the product images
the names of the product
the colors and sizes
quantity
Tap
Accept Task
.
If the product is missing, it is marked as unavailable with an icon on the Runner request itself. So the sales associate can identify all products that cannot be found. However, if a user finds the unavailable product, the product can be marked as available.
After locating the products, a Runner can complete the task by tapping
Complete Task
.
Communicating about a runner task
The Runner can communicate with the sales associate who has raised the runner request, if notifications are turned on in the app.
During a runner request, the Runner creates a new note for the sales associate, and the sales associate who created the request is notified. Similarly, the sales associate can respond to the Runner by adding another note and the Runner is notified.
You can either type the note or use the microphone icon on the keyboard to dictate the note.
All users in the store can view notes on Runner requests, including notes entered for completed runner requests via applicable filters.
