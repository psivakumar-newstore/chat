Prerequisite
Complete
Module 1 - Foundational Setup
and
Returns
before you proceed on Exchanges.
When a customer initiates a return, the store associate can easily look up the
Order
using various methods:
Scanning the QR code on the
Sales receipt
(paper or email)
Entering the order number in the Associate App
Using the Gift receipt
Searching by customer
Profile
(if associated with the order)
Once the order is selected, the associate can begin the return process, which will prompt them to enter:
A return reason code
The condition (return disposition code) of the
Product
being returned
After selecting the return reason code and condition (return disposition code), the associate can add more products to the return if needed. If there are no more products to be returned, the associate can apply the credit amount to the cart. Once done, the associate can add the products to the cart and apply the credit for the new sales.
There can be two scenarios for exchanges(Return and Purchase).
Even Exchange→ In a Return and Purchase scenario, the products being returned and the new products being purchased are of equal value. In this case, the customer does not need to make any additional payment, as the values are identical.
Unlike Exchange → In a Return and Purchase scenario, the products being returned and the new products being purchased are not equal. Two possible scenarios can play out in this situation:
When the customer returns a product and receives a new product of lesser value, they will receive a
Refund
for the
Price
difference.
When the customer returns a product and receives a new product of greater value. The customer will be asked by the associate to pay for the additional amount.
Exchange Payment Strategy
- To support, exchanges, we should configure a payment strategy for the same. Refer to
Configuring exchanges as a payment strategy
on how to configure the Exchange Payment Strategy.
Though Return and Purchase are treated as one single transaction, the return gets updated to the original order and the new sale will be created as a new sales order with the
Payment method
as credit for the amount that was returned.
Additional configurations
