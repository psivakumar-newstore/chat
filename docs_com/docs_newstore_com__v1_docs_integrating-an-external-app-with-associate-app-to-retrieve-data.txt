If your business needs to retrieve data from an external mobile app or web application, such as customer data or loyalty reward coupons, NewStore allows you to integrate these applications with NewStore Associate App to fetch such data via deeplink URLs.
To set up NewStore Associate App to retrieve data from an external application or system, NewStore Associate App must be able to communicate with the external app via deeplink URLs. In this setup, NewStore sends required data via a deeplink URL, then waits for a response from the external application via another deeplink URL.
NewStore has a set of integration points that your external application can communicate with to receive and send back data. These integration points are specified in the NewStore Associate App
configuration API
, within the
external_integration
property.
For example, you can specify that loyalty reward points can be accessed in NewStore Associate App via a deeplink URL that retrieves data from your external loyalty system.
Schema for integration points and deeplink URL
These integration points can send and retrieve required data via the following mechanism:
Integration point
Data sent
Callback action
Query parameters
Available in app version
cart.more.loyaltyProgram
Cart details
applyCoupons
coupons[]
cartId
v1.13.0 and later
When setting up the deeplink URL for your external application in NewStore Associate App, follow this URL schema to ensure that NewStore Associate App can send and retrieve data correctly:
Protocol
:
com.newstore.associate-one://
Domain
: Name of the integration point, such as
cart.more.loyaltyProgram
Path
: Callback action, based on the integration point, such as
applyCoupons
QueryParams
: Based on the integration point and the associated action. For example, for
cart.more.loyaltyProgram/applyCoupons
, the value can be
coupons[]=first_code&coupons[]=second_code.....
NewStore also assigns a 32-bit security token for each deeplink URL for authentication purposes. The external app must pass this token back as part of the
queryParams
segment in the URL.
See the following example for the complete format for a callback URL:
com.newstore.associate-one://cart.more.loyaltyProgram/applyCoupons?coupons[]=couponID-1&coupons[]=couponID-2&cartId=123456&token=abcdef
Important
After you have set up the configuration to retrieve data from the external application(s), in the request payload for the
Update App configuration
method, use the
external_integration
property to specify the required details to enable NewStore Associate App to retrieve the data.
Currently, NewStore only supports retrieving loyalty reward data from an external system. For more information, see
Configuring loyalty rewards on Associate App
.
