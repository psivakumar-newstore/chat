We recommend reading these FAQs before importing SFCC data into the NewStore platform. For more information on the import process, read the
integration guide
or the
tutorial
.
During local imports on SFCC, if a child job fails, do I have to run a full import again?
Yes. For more information about doing a full import, see
Importing data
.
How many times can SFCC data imports be attempted if a job fails during the first attempt?
NewStore allows a total of four attempts for SFCC data imports. We will attempt a retry of the data import 10 minutes after it fails. The retry is only attempted for each of the first three failed attempts. During this whole time, the status of the import job is displayed as
failed
.
What should I do if my import is in the
processing
state for a long time?
If your import is still in the
processing
state after 2 hours, start a new import job using the
Start import job method
.
