Customer creation
A customer is created manually using NewStore Associate App or via the checkout process when they provide their email address. See
Managing customers
The
customer.created
event is emitted.
Customer modification
Once a customer is created, it can be modified in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, see
Editing customer details
:
Updating the customer information, such as their name, triggers the
customer.updated
event.
Updating the address triggers the
customer.address_updated
event.
Adding an address, for shipping or billing, triggers the
customer.address_created
event.
Deleting an address triggers the
customer.address_deleted
event.
