Check the return details and tap

A new shopping cart is created, containing the item(s) to be returned.

If all of the items from an order are returned, the shipping cost for the order is refunded to the customer. The refunded amount for shipping costs is available in the return receipt of the order.
Once the shopping cart is ready with the items that will be returned to the customer for a refund, proceed to

Choosing a refund option
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To set up refund options for the retailer, see
Configuring refund options
.
Tap
Refund
.
Select a refund option from the following options:
New Gift card
: Issues a new gift card for the refund amount. This option may not be available if your store's policies don't allow refunds to gift cards.
Enter the following details if required by your business and tap
Add Gift Card
:
Gift Card Number
PIN
for the gift card
The customer's email address
New Electronic Gift card
: Issues an electronic gift card for the refund amount, which is sent to the customer's email address.
Present Card for Refund
: Allows you to swipe the credit/debit card that should receive the refund.
Note
Currently, you cannot enter a credit/debit card number manually to receive the refund.
Original Payment Method
: Refunds to the original payment method that was used to pay for the item via an external order management system.
For orders that were paid for via external payment options such as
WeChatPay
or
AliPay
, this option is disabled by default. Use the
External Payment Method
to refund the amount instead.
Important
This refund method only works if the order number for the returned item, from the external order management system, was entered during the return process.
If the customer used several credit cards to pay, each credit card is refunded for the amount that was deducted from it.
Certain debit cards cannot be refunded without swiping them again. In this case, use the
Present Card for Refund
option.
External Payment
(refund method): If enabled for your business, use this method to record refunds via an external payment provider that is not integrated into NewStore. Retailers can define several external payment methods that associates can select to represent the various non-integrated payments in use.
Store associates can see the specific payment methods used in the original order when viewing the customer order within the Associate App. Retailers may want to display the same granularity for the refund options when using external payment systems as they have for the initial payments. See
Configuring Refund Options
for specifics.
Note
Retailers should consider it a best practice to have the same external refund options as they do for the payment options. This will ensure a match between payment options and refund options and also help in reconciliation.
Associates can skip selecting an
External Payment
refund method if it does not match the external refund requested by the shopper. They can also dismiss the "Refund Methods" view and complete the return and refund process. NewStore will record the refund for this transaction as
External Payment
within the associate app. Within the NewStore Omnichannel Manager, event stream, and APIs, the payment method used for this transaction will be shown as
non_integrated
