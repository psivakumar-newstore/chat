Associates can use NewStore Associate App for the following tasks if these features have been enabled for their business:
Receiving inventory
Transferring inventory
Cycle count inventory
Performing full counts
Adjusting inventory
Receiving inventory
Associates can use NewStore Associate App to receive inventory, if the feature has been configured for their store.
Currently, NewStore allows associates to use NewStore Associate App to receive only carton-level inventory into the store.
Pre-requisites
To receive inventory via cartons, retailers must include carton IDs in the
ASN
data imported into the NewStore platform. For more information, see the sample payload of the
Create ASN
method.
You must also have the
basic inventory permissions
to use NewStore Associate App before you could transfer inventory. Talk to your store manager or IT support team for more information.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
Before receiving inventory using Associate App, enable the store to do so using the
Update app configuration
method and set the
enabled_carton_receiving_stores
property to the IDs of stores where you want to receive the inventory.
Receiving inventory with a carton ID
To receive inventory into your store via NewStore Associate App:
Tap
Inventory
.
Tap
Receiving > Scan carton
.
Note
The
Scan carton
button is enabled only if the carton-level inventory receiving via NewStore Associate App is configured for your business. For more information, see
Pre-requisites
.
Important
It is not possible to scan a carton after starting to
receive inventory with ASN
.
Scan each carton that you want to receive. After scanning each carton, verify that the number of items and the items for each product received are correct.
Note
If the ASN of the physical shipment is not yet on NewStore, you will see this message displayed:
Unable to receive carton. Carton ## not found.
If the ASN is on NewStore but the carton information is not available, the same message is displayed.
If the ASN of the physical shipment was injected into the platform, but failed due to a separate issue such as a product missing from the catalog or missing store information, the app displays:
This delivery is not available due to a technical issue. Try again later.
After the root cause is resolved and the ASN is replayed on the third-party system, you can start seeing the ASN on Associate App or try again to scan the carton and receive the shipment.
Tap
Receive Carton
.
Follow the above steps to continue receiving remaining cartons that have arrived in the store.
Receiving inventory with an ASN
To receive inventory against an ASN into your store via Associate App:
Tap
Inventory
.
Tap
Receiving > Receive with ASN
to start scanning the items in the shipment.
Note
The
Receive with ASN
button is enabled only if the NewStore Associate App is configured for your business. For more information, see
Pre-requisites
.
Check the ASN list.
Find the ASN ID of the shipment that arrived into the store and tap on it.
Check whether any shipments have already been received for this ASN or not.
Tap
Start Receiving
.
Tap
Receive Items
to scan the barcode of the product or tap on the product to manually update the quantity.
If configured for your business, you can remove the manual update of the quantity and force the associates to scan all units. For more information, see
Configuring manual quantity updates
.
Tap
Complete Receive
to submit the received inventory.
View the completed ASNs
Tap
Inventory
.
Tap
Receiving > Receive with ASN
to start scanning the items in the shipment.
Note
The
Receive with ASN
button is enabled only if the NewStore Associate App is configured for your business. For more information, see
Pre-requisites
.
Tap on the Completed tab.
Tap on the ASN of interest to see the related receiving transactions.
Tap on the receiving transaction to see the product details.
Receiving excess inventory with an ASN
If configured for your business, you can receive a product that is not in the ASN, or receive a quantity that is more than what is expected in the ASN. This is also called overreceiving.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
See
Enabling overreceiving with an ASN
.
For example, when receiving excess inventory is enabled for your business:
If you find Emily Dress, Size 6, Black, in the shipment but not in the ASN, you can receive the product.
If the quantity of the dress in the ASN is 2, but you find 3 in the shipment, you can receive the third dress.
Receiving inventory without an ASN
To receive inventory without any reference such as an ASN into your store via Associate App :
Tap
Inventory
.
Tap
Receiving > Receive without ASN
to start scanning the items in the shipment.
Note
The
Receive without ASN
button is enabled only if the NewStore Associate App is configured for your business. For more information, see
Pre-requisites
.
Enter
Shipment Reference
(ASN ID) and/or
Order Reference
(Purchase Order ID).
Tap
Receive Items
to scan the barcode of the product or tap on the product to manually update the quantity.
If configured for your business, you can remove the manual update of the quantity and force the associates to scan all units. For more information, see
Configuring manual quantity updates
.
Tap
Complete Receive
to submit the received inventory.
Managing ASNs
Retail Operations Managers or Inventory Controllers Associates can use NewStore Omnichannel Manager to manage the ASNs and force close, if needed.
Force closing an ASN
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the View inventory management permission.
When inventory is received into your store, an ASN is closed automatically. You can also force close the ASN manually when inventory is received partially into your store from the warehouse, and you do not want to receive the remaining part of the inventory.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable this feature, see
Enabling inventory reports in NewStore Omnichannel Manager
.
To force close a specific
ASN
:
Click
Store Operations
>
Inventory
>
ASN
.
Click the specific
ASN Number
that you want to force close.
Click
Force close ASN
, and in the dialog box that appears, click
Confirm
.
The status of the ASN changes to
Closed
and the user who closed the ASN is displayed on the ASN detail page in Omnichannel Manager. In Associate App, the ASN is moved to the
Completed ASNs
area.
If you are using an ERP to manage your inventory, it is notified about the status of the ASN via their integration with NewStore. For more information, see the
Integration guides
and
Event-Stream Webhooks
documentation.
Transferring inventory
Associates can use NewStore Associate App to transfer inventory from their stores, if the feature has been configured for their business.
Note
Associates can create multiple transactions within one transfer order to transfer inventory. If you want to limit the number of transactions per transfer order, train your associates and communicate such limits accordingly. NewStore does not provide a configuration to limit transactions for a transfer order.
The business use cases of inventory transfer transactions are described as follows:
Steps
Use case 1
Use case 2
1. Transfer requested or created
The inventory controller or HQ person requests an inventory transfer from NYC store 1 to NYC store 2 using the ERP or a third-party system.
The associate from NYC store 2 calls or emails NYC store 1 to transfer inventory. The associate from NYC store 1 creates an inventory transfer to NYC store 2 using NewStore Associate App.
2. Transfer completed
The associate from NYC store 1 fulfills the transfer using Associate App.
3. Transfer received
The associate from NYC store 2 receives the transfer with an ASN. If NYC store 1 has additional stock or it has not been sold for a long time, the inventory is transferred to a warehouse.
Pre-requisites
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
Before transferring inventory using Associate App, enable the store to do so using the
Update app configuration
method and set the
enable_initiating_transfers
property to
true
.
You must also have the

Creating a full count
This feature can be adopted by the retailers who manage their inventory with NewStore.
Prerequisites
Handover all fulfilled orders before activating the count.
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Create cycle counts permission.
You can create a full count for inventory in your business via Omnichannel Manager, if the store's inventory is managed on NewStore platform.
To create a full count:
Go to
Store Operations
>
Inventory
>
Counts
.
Click
Create Count
.
In the
Create count
screen, enter the following details:
Name
: Specify the name of the count.
Type
: Cycle Count or Full Count.
Store
: To add a group of stores or a specific store, click

Due Date
: Specify the date when the full count will take place.
Information on how the count zones will be created out of NewStore currently.
You have to split your store into zones by using QR Codes. These zones will then be recorded into your results. To use this feature, generate QR codes with an online tool and set the value of the QR code as "Text". The text value will be the name of your zones, such as
Zone 1
or
Zone 2
.
Note
Associates using the app cannot perform full counts without scanning a zone QR code first.
Click
Create Count
.
The full count entry is now displayed on the
Counts
page in Omnichannel Manager.
Important
The full count entry will have no details until it is activated in the store by the store or count manager on the day of the count. When not activated, the page displays
Full Count Not Active
when the full count is active, products that are part of the count are displayed.
A full count cannot be created if there is a full count that has already been activated. Complete or cancel the active full count, and only then you can create another full count for the store.
Activating a full count
Best practices
The more count zones the better for distributing the workload and checking the variances and recounting zones.
Handover the fulfilled orders before activating the count as they will be included in the stock on hand snapshot. ( Team is evaluating solution ideas to mitigate this).
Activate just before starting the count, as this will get record the baseline stock on hand.
Do not sell or move inventory during the count, as in this first iteration we don’t have enough functionalities to equip the retailers to easily see and adjust the inventory impacts.
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Activate full counts permission.
You can activate a full count for inventory in your business via Omnichannel Manager. This will enable the count to be visible and actionable on Associate App in the store.
Important
If not activated, associates in the store cannot see the count and cannot start counting. There is no control over the date and activation. The activation captures the snapshot of the stock on hand in the store.
To activate a full count:
Go to
Store Operations
>
Inventory
>
Counts
.
Find the count you want to activate.
Click
Activate Count
.
The products in the store will be listed with
ProductID
,
Zones
(which are empty by default),
Expected Quantity
,
Counted Quantity
(which are all set to
0
by default) and
Variance
(which is derived by subtracting the
Expected Quantity
from the
Counted Quantity
).
Associates can now start counting, as the active count allows them to start scanning a zone. See
Performing full counts
.
Performing full counts
Use full counts in Associate App to count products within designated count zones.
Important
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
The Full Count option is enabled only if full counts have been enabled for your business. To enable full counts via Associate App, set the enabled_full_counts_stores property to true in the
Associate App Configuration API
.
To count inventory items in your store via Associate App:
Tap
>
Inventory
.
Tap
Full Count
.
Check if there is an active full count and the
Open the Scanner
button is visible and actionable.
Scan the count zone QR code. Tap the screen to continue. If the zone was counted before, the app will ask if you'd like to recount the zone or cancel the new count.
Scan each product in the count zone one after the other by tapping on the screen.
This helps you stay in control of the scanning process. Check each product as you scan them, which appears at the bottom of the page.
The app provides a haptic feedback each time a product is scanned, based on
success
(product scanned) or
failure
(product unavailable in the catalog).
Type the barcode, in case the barcode is not in scannable condition.
In case you notice a mistake in the count, remove the scanned barcode from the list by tapping
X
on the left of the barcode.
Once all products have been scanned, tap
Complete Zone
.
If the store manager asks for the zone to be recounted, repeat the same process, which overwrites the previous count.
Note
Multiple users can scan multiple zones at once, given they are scanning different zones. A zone can only be scanned by one associate. We recommend creating smaller count zones, so the store can be divided into more zones, distributing the workload evenly among associates. Discrepancies can be checked for at the end of the count.
