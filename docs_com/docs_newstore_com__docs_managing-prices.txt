A
price book
represents a collection of prices for products, in a specific currency. You can import multiple price books and specify whether the set of prices is inclusive or exclusive of taxes. For example, each sales channel can have a different price book.
Products will only be available in the system if they have a price attached to their specific
shop
.
Pre-requisites
To be able to use a price book that we import in this process, we must assign it to a store. See
Tutorial: Setting up a store
.
Importing price books
The expected structure of the price book after a successful import is represented by
this JSON schema
. Ensure that you read the description of the properties of this schema before you start importing a price book.
The price book import step contains the following specificities:
The first price book you import has to be called
default
.
Important
A
shop
can only contain one
default
price book in a specific currency. Importing another
default
price book with a different currency overwrites the previous price book. Every default pricebook is independent for each
shop
.
To retrieve the prices in this price book, use the
List products method
. To get prices from another price book, use the
Get prices method
.
shop
: Must be set to the corresponding shop of the product.
Important
Ensure that you specify the correct number of decimal places for monetary values of prices, according to the specified currency. For example, if the currency is specified as USD and the price has more than 2 decimal places, it is considered as invalid by the platform, and the import is unsuccessful.
For more information, see
