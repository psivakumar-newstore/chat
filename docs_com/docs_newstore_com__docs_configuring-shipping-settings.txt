Here's a list of settings that you can configure for your business, to customize shipping solutions.
Adding shipping providers
To add shipping providers that your business wants to integrate with:
Use the
Get carrier config
method to retrieve the shipping providers that you already have set up.
Use the
Update carrier config
method to add a new shipping provider to your configuration:
In the
value
key, specify the name of the shipping provider as the new key. For example,
FEDEX
.
In
booking_includes_return
, specify
true
if the return delivery will be booked in the same API call as the shipping delivery.
In
api_base_url
, specify the shipping provider adapter URL where the requests from NewStore Omnichannel Cloud can be posted.
In
integration_type
, map the service that should be called. This can be one of these two values:
generic
(for generic adapter API calls) or
traditional_carrier
(shipment API calls).
In
return_deliveries_should_be_canceled
, specify
true
if return shipping needs to be canceled.
Configuring EasyPost for shipping
Creating an EasyPost shipping configuration
To configure
EasyPost
for shipping, create an EasyPost shipping configuration that is integrated with the EasyPost adapter. For help with this integration, contact the
support team
.
Configuring EasyPost
After you have created the EasyPost shipping configuration, follow the same steps as
Adding shipping providers
, with one difference:
In
value
>
<carrier_name>
>
api_base_url
, provide the adapter URL for EasyPost for each shipping provider.
Important
To process electronic commercial invoices via EasyPost, ensure that electronic or paperless invoicing has been pre-approved by shipping provider. Approval processes typically take up to 24 hours.
For example, if you are using
UPS
as your shipping provider, follow these steps to request for paperless commercial invoicing approval:
Log into your UPS account.
Select
Enroll Paperless invoicing
and select the types of paperless invoicing you plan to use.
Upload a letterhead and signature to be associated with all shipments.
Wait for approval.
Configuring the shipping adapter URL
Updating the EasyPost configuration
To update an existing EasyPost configuration, follow these steps:
Retrieve the current configuration via the
GET Config
method.
Copy existing config and paste the entire JSON in the “Body” of the PUT Config request
Use the
Replace EasyPost adapter config
method to update configuration.
Possible configuration keys are listed below:
easypost_api_key
base_customization_url
ignore_customization_failure_on_booking
newstore_username
newstore_password
newstore_url
shipment_creation_options
(This is a key/value dictionary based on
https://www.easypost.com/docs/api#options
)
carrier_accounts
where,
You must set
newstore_url
to:
https://<tenant>.p.newstore.net/v0/
, for example:
https://dodici.p.newstore.net/v0/
See the example for
shipment_creation_options
:
"shipment_creation_options": {
    "fedex": {
        "delivery_confirmation": "SIGNATURE"
    }
}
See an example for
carrier_accounts
, where
US01
is a fulfillment location (
fulfillment_node_id
)
"carrier_accounts": {
    "fedex": {
        "US01": "ca_abc...",
    }
}
Important
If an EasyPost account has a large number of
carrier_accounts
, map a warehouse or DC (
fulfillment_node_id
) to a carrier account. Failing to do so will result in requesting shipping options for orders to time out after 30 seconds.
Enabling customizable provider rates
To customize provider rates:
Use the
Set customization adapter config
method and in
value
>
base_url
, specify the URL of the customization adapter used to retrieve the list of supported provider rates for the order.
Use the
Set config for customizable provider rates
method.
Set
value
to
true
.
To retrieve the current configuration, use the
Get config for customizable provider rates
method.
To retrieve the current configuration of customization adapter for provider rates, use the
Get customization adapter config
method.
Customizing the shipping configuration
Your shipping configuration contains provider rates, return shipping provider rates, service levels, service-level priorities, and routes that are required to offer shipping options.
At NewStore, the fulfillment configuration contains the shipping configuration. To include shipping provider settings, update the
fulfillment configuration
for your business. See
Tutorial: Setting up a fulfillment configuration (Legacy method)
.
To update service levels for inventory transfers, update the
transfer order delivery configuration
for your business. For an example of the configuration, see
Shipping transfer orders
.
If configured, NewStore does not update shipping offers for orders routed to warehouses or DCs for fulfillment. To enable this configuration, use the
Skip shipping offer updates for DC orders
method and set
value
to
true
.
Note
We recommend skipping shipping offers for orders routed to warehouses or DCs in your business.
Exclude DC rates when injecting orders
When injecting orders into NewStore, shipping options are generated by calling shipping carriers. This configuration allows retailers to avoid calling shipping carriers for DC rates. If
use_as_customer_facing_cost
property is set to
true
in the
provider rate API
, the shipping carrier will still be called to retrieve shipping costs.
To enable this configuration, in the
API
, set the config
generate_static_option_for_dc
to:
{
    "value": true
}
Important
Ensure that any active customizations for the shipping adapter are not impacted by the exclusion of calling DC rates from shipping carriers.
We recommend excluding DC rates during the order injection phase, right when shipping options and provider rates are being created.
Note
We recommend excluding DC rates at Order Injection.
Customizing the shipping price for split orders
For split orders, update this configuration to charge the customer the highest shipping price across all the service-levels offered for the order, and ignore the rest of the shipping prices. This is irrespective of the number of shipments the order was split into. For more information, see
Shipping split orders
.
To charge the customer only the shipping price for the most expensive shipment in the split order:
Use the
Set shipping price config for split orders
method.
Set
value
to
true
.
To retrieve the current configuration, use the
Get shipping price config for split orders
method.
For examples on how the shipping price is customized when you use this key, see
Shipping price for split orders
.
For more information on the service level price, see
Tutorial: Setting up a fulfillment configuration (Legacy method)
.
Customizing shipment limits for orders
You can use NewStore Omnichannel Manager to specify the maximum number of shipments for orders that have high shipping costs or are split between multiple fulfillment locations. See
Managing shipment limits
.
Configuring international shipping
A retailer can ship orders internationally for their business using the EasyPost adapter. To enable international shipments,
