Important
If you use the legacy printer management framework in Associate App, see
Configuring printers using the legacy framework
.
Configure NewStore Associate App to manage the printers that you use in your store during the checkout process.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable the new printer management framework in Associate App:
Go to the
Associate App configuration API
.
Set
release_toggles
>
new_printer_management
to
true
.
Recommended printer setup
You can use any type of printer to print labels or receipt documents in the store with the new printer management framework in Associate App. To begin setting up a printer in the store, see
this section
.
Note
You can only use the
Zebra
printers (with LAN or WiFi connectivity) to print product barcodes or hang tags in the store. For more information, see
Hardware and software support
.
If your store operates in a country where
fiscal regulations
apply, you can also add a fiscal printer to print documents to comply with
fiscalization
requirements.
To enable adding fiscal printers to your store via Associate App programmatically, see
Configuring fiscal documents to print via NewStore Associate App
.
Setting up a printer
Set up a printer to be able to print sales receipts:
Tap
>
Configure Printers
, or tap the navigation drawer menu >
Settings
>
Configure Printers
.
In the
Printer Management
screen, tap
Add Printer
.
Select the manufacturer or model of the printer, such as
Epson
,
AirPrint
,
Star
or
Zebra
printers.
The app scans your network to find AirPrint or other printers. To learn how to configure your AirPrint printer, refer to the
Apple guide
.
Select the printer from the list of printers that appears.
In the
New Printer
screen:
Verify the
Model
name
Specify an (optional) name for the printer, such as
Ground Floor Printer
Specify the document types that can be printed using the printer, such as
Packing Slip
,
Invoice
,
Sales Receipt
, and tap
Done
.
Important
You must select at least 1 document type to be able to add the printer to the app.
For a Zebra printer, you must specify the IP address of the printer to be able to connect to it.
For an AirPrint printer, you must select a model to print on. You can also select the option to specify a printer every time you print. This provides an experience similar to the AirPrint only mode, in which you can select additional options to print documents, such as double-sided printing or selecting a specific tray to print from.
Tap
Add
.
The printer is added to the list of available printers in the store.
If you are using a
Zebra
printer, you can test your printer by tapping
Test Print
.
Tap the printer to manage it. See
Managing printers
.
Setting up a default printer
Default printers are specific to each device. By setting a printer as default for each receipt or document, associates do not need to choose a printer during every checkout transaction. The default printer settings apply to the device you configured, and it will be available for all associates who log in and use the app on the same device.
Set up printers in the store before assigning one as the default printer. To set up a printer in the store, see
this section
.
To set up a default printer to print a specific type of document, such as sales receipts:
Tap
>
Configure Printers
>
Document Defaults
, or tap the navigation drawer menu >
Settings
>
Configure Printers
>
Document Defaults
.
Tap
Select
for Sales receipt.
Select the printer from the list of available printers.
In the screen that appears, tap
Yes
.
Managing printers
Tap
>
Configure Printers
, or tap the navigation drawer menu >
Settings
>
Configure Printers
.
In the
Printer Management
screen, tap the printer you want to manage.
You can update the name of the printer or change the list of document types that can be printed using the printer.
Tap
Save
after you made the required changes to the printer.
(Optional) To delete the printer, tap
Delete
and in the dialog box that appears, tap
Delete
again.
(Optional) Using only Airprint-enabled printers
Associates can use the AirPrint only option to print documents, which removes the need to set up specific printers in Associate App. All you need is an AirPrint compatible printer that is paired with the app.
This also increases possible options to print documents via Airprint compatible printers, such as double-sided printing or selecting a specific tray to print from.
Important
When this option is enabled, you
cannot use
Star or Zebra printers to print documents, as these models do not communicate with the app via AirPrint.
Go to the
Associate App configuration API
.
Set
capabilities
>
printer_management
>
air_print
to
true
.
(Optional) Setting up a fiscal printer
If your store operates in a country where hardware
fiscal regulations
apply, you will need to set up a
fiscal printer
to print fiscal documents such as sales receipts and
X or Z
reports.
To set up a fiscal printer to print fiscal documents:
Ensure that the printer is using the same Wi-Fi network as NewStore Associate App.
Tap
>
Configure Printers
, or tap the navigation drawer menu >
Settings
>
Configure Printers
.
In the
Printer Management
screen, tap
Add Printer
.
Select the manufacturer or model of the fiscal printer, such as
Epson
in Italy or
Posnet
in Poland.
In the
New Printer
screen:
Select the
Printer Model
.
For example, if you are operating in Poland, select
Posnet Thermal XL2 Online
.
Specify a name for the fiscal printer, such as
Ground Floor Fiscal Printer
.
Specify the
IP Address
of the fiscal printer.
Important
The fiscal printer must be configured with a static IP address. If you assign a dynamic IP address, you have to reconfigure the fiscal printer every time the IP address changes.
Specify the
Port
of the fiscal printer.
Tap
Save
.
If there are issues connecting to the printer, ensure that Associate App is able to access the configured ports of the printer and try again.
The fiscal printer is now added to the list of available printers in the store.
Tap the printer to manage it. See
(Optional) Managing fiscal printers
.
Note
When you add an Epson fiscal printer to the NewStore platform, certain printer parameters, such as the VAT and department tables, are configured automatically.
The configuration of VAT tables and departments is only possible if the printer is not in
Day Opened
state. If the printer is in
Day Opened
state, the fiscal printer will automatically generate a Z-report, and will configure the VAT and department tables.
Important
Fiscal printers must meet the following conditions before being added to the NewStore platform in test mode:
The Epson RT fiscal printers should be in training mode.
The Posnet Online fiscal printers should not be fiscalized.
Ensure that you have a backup fiscal printer in the store, as Associate App will block a sale if it cannot connect to the fiscal printer.
(Optional) Managing fiscal printers
Tap
>
Configure Printers
, or tap the navigation drawer menu >
Settings
>
Configure Printers
.
In the
Printer Management
screen, tap the fiscal printer you want to manage.
You can update the name of the printer or change the connection parameters of the fiscal printer.
Tap
Save
after you made the required changes to the printer.
Important
If the fiscal printer is not fiscally activated, a warning message is displayed at the top of the screen. You have to reactivate the fiscal printer by tapping the
Save
button.
If the connection parameters (such as the
IP Address
or
Port
) of a fiscal printer are updated, the fiscal printer will be reactivated.
(Optional) To delete the printer, tap
Delete
and in the dialog box that appears, tap
Delete
again.
(Optional) To print a test page, tap
More
>
Print Test Page
.
(Optional) To test if the fiscal printer is ready to process orders, tap
More
>
Perform readiness check
.
The result of the readiness check indicates the status of the printer. For example, whether the printer is running out of paper, or having network connectivity issues.
