If enabled for your business, you can offer gift card cash-outs to customers, and can also check the available balance on a gift card.
To check the balance on a gift card and to offer a cash-out to the customer against it:
Tap
and scan the barcode of the gift card.
(Optional)
You can also enter the gift card number or SKU in the app.
If the gift card is valid, the
Gift Card Details
screen appears with the following information:
Status
: Displays
Active
or
Inactive
based on the validity of the gift card.
Balance
: Displays the balance remaining on the gift card.
Gift Card Number
: Displays the gift card ID number or SKU.
To offer a cash-out for the customer, tap
Cashout Gift Card
.
In the
Confirm Gift Card Cashout
screen that appears, the amount available for offering a cash-out is displayed.
To go back to the scanner or the manual entry screen in the app, tap
Close
.
Tap
Process Cashout
and enter the PIN required to redeem the cash-out for the gift card.
If the store uses an
integrated cash drawer
, the app opens the cash drawer to allow you to offer the necessary cash to the customer. For a non-integrated cash drawer, you must manually open the drawer and remove the necessary cash for the customer.
Important
If
PIN validation for gift cards
is not enabled for your business, the app reduces the money in the integrated cash drawer by the specified cash-out amount when you tap
Process Cashout
.
If
PIN validation for gift cards
is
enabled
for your business, the app reduces the money in the integrated cash drawer by the specified cash-out amount
only
when you tap
Process Cashout
and enter a valid PIN.
If there is not enough cash in the drawer, you need to resolve this within your audit or business process. NewStore does not take this into account, and the app considers the gift card cash-out transaction to be successful when you tap
Process Checkout
.
If the entered PIN is valid, a confirmation screen appears with a
Gift Card Cashout Successful
confirmation message displayed.
Note
If the PIN entered is not valid or wrong, this error message is displayed:
Gift Card Cashout Unsuccessful - do not remove cash from the drawer. Please try again, or contact support.
Tap
Okay
to restart the cash-out process or tap
Retry PIN
to retry entering the PIN for the gift card.
Tap
Done
.
