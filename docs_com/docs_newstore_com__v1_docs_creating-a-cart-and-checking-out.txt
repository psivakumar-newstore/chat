Creating a cart
The shopping cart, or cart, contains the items selected by the customer but not yet checked out.
NewStore Associate App allows you to check out items that are in your store, or in a different location (other
store
, or
DC
). You can search for items by brand, category, color and style.
Checking product stock levels
Note
Products are sorted by availability by default in the catalog.
To check if the product is in stock at your store, or if it is available at another location:
Find the product via the app's catalog by tapping
and
Search
or scan the item.
On the
Product Details
screen, tap
Inventory Lookup
.
(Optional)
If enabled for your business, you can print a hang tag for the product if needed. Talk to your store manager for more information.
To print hang tags, on the
Product Details
screen, tap
Print Hang Tags
, select the number of copies you want to print and tap
Print
.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
See
Printing in-store hang tags using additional pricebooks
.
If NewStore does not manage inventory in the store, the
ATP
for the product at each warehouse and store is displayed. The ATP for your store is displayed first in the list of stores. Apart from your store, only those stores that have ATP of at least
1
are displayed.
When NewStore manages
inventory in your store
, the
stock on hand
value for the product is displayed instead of the ATP on the
Product Details
screen.
The sellable stock on hand is displayed for products in these scenarios:
Scenario
Example
When stock on hand is available
5 items in your store
When stock on hand is negative, such as when you sell items that have been returned by customers. In this case, the stock on hand may turn negative until you perform a
cycle count
in the store.
-2 items in your store
No inventory for the product in the store
Not in stock in your store
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
By default, NewStore Associate App is configured to display warehouses before stores. This can be customized via an extension point in the NewStore Associate App.
To filter the locations that are displayed in the
Product Lookup
screen, see
Customizing NewStore Associate App
.
By default products can be searched by title, description, color, size, and caption but not by product IDs or
SKU
. If you want to be able to search for products using a specific identifier, add the field as a
searchable_attributes
in the head section of your product import JSON payload. For more information, see the
JSON schema for products
.
(Optional) Customizing products
If enabled for your business, you can customize products based on the individual preferences of a customer before adding these products or items to the cart.
Find the product via the app's catalog by tapping
and
Search
or scan the item.
On the
Product Details
screen, tap
Customize Product
and add the required customizations for the product before adding it to the cart.
Adding an in-store item
If the item is available in your store:

(Optional) If your business uses serial numbers to track items during the fulfillment cycle, tap
Add Serial Number
to add the serial number for the item before adding the item to the cart.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team or partner for more information. See
Using serialized inventory
.
If your business uses RFID Tags and has a QR code containing the Electronic Product Code (EPC)  printed on the tags, scan the QR code to add the product to the cart. This also captures the serial number of the unique item. The EPC and the decoded serial number will be displayed on the cart.
Technical configuration
If the barcode type QR  or CodeTypeAll is not configured yet, use this
configuration
to add them into the app. See also Set up Electronic Product Code (EPC) Support.
If there is an RFID reader connected, add products to the cart by placing them on the RFID reader. For more information, see

Adding an endless aisle item
NewStore Associate App allows you to process an
endless aisle
order by adding an item to an in-store cart that is available at another fulfillment location, but unavailable at your store.
Retailers can configure their endless aisle checkout flows to ship items directly to a customer’s address or directly to specified store locations.
Retailers also can configure their checkout process to allow for
mixed carts
. Mixed carts contain both in-store cash and carry items and items that have been designated for shipment to the customer’s address or a store location for pickup. See
Choosing a payment option
.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To enable the mixed cart feature, see
Enabling mixed carts in NewStore Associate App
.
To configure endless aisle checkout flows to offer the ability to ship directly to store locations, see the
Update Associate App configuration method
to configure the ship-to-store option.
Cash, as a form of payment for endless aisle and mixed cart orders, is not enabled by default. However, retailers can enable cash as a payment method if desired. However, when using cash as a payment method, retailers must be mindful of refund challenges for items that could not be shipped. To enable cash payments for endless aisle and mixed cart orders, see
Enabling cash payments for endless aisle and mixed cart orders in NewStore Associate App
.
Assign a customer to the cart. If no customer profile exists for the shopper, first create the customer profile. Assign the newly created customer to the cart.
Tap
.
To find the product you are looking for, do one of the following:

If enabled for your business, tap
+
to add additional quantities of the same item.
Important

Tap
Add to cart
. If the
mixed cart
feature is enabled, select one of the following options for each item in the cart:
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
See
Enabling mixed carts in NewStore Associate App
.
It's in the store to sell
: This option indicates that the specific item added to the cart is available in the store. The customer will be handed the item once checkout is complete.
Ship it to the customer
: This option indicates that the specific item is
NOT
available in the store and therefore must be shipped to the customer or to a store location. Select this option for endless-aisle items.
Repeat the previous step for all items requested by the customer.
See
Checking out a shopping cart
.
Important
Remember to add a delivery option for this item to complete the checkout. This includes an endless item that was ordered individually or as part of a mixed cart order. See
Adding delivery options
.
Saving and restoring carts
After adding items to a cart, you can save the cart and return to it at any time to complete the purchase.
Important
Delivery options added to a cart are not saved, when you save the cart. Ensure that you add delivery options again when you restore a saved cart. See
Adding delivery options
.
All saved carts are automatically removed when you
erase local app data
and cannot be restored.
To save a cart:
Tap
More
.
Tap
Save Cart
.
Note
The cart is saved on the device, not on your account.
When you save a cart, the inventory related to the cart is not
reserved
.
To restore a cart:
Ensure your current cart is empty and has no customer assigned to it.
Tap
, and tap
Saved Carts
. The list of carts saved on the device is displayed. Some of the carts might belong to other associates.
Tap
Restore
on the cart that you want to use. The cart is restored and displays the items that you or another associate added earlier. You can now add more items to the cart or continue to checkout.
Note
When you restore the cart, it is removed from the saved carts.
Once you place the order, the order is assigned to you instead of the associate who created the cart.
Creating a cart from an RFID basket
If your business uses an RFID-enabled checkout basket, follow these steps to create a checkout operation in Associate App for the items in the basket:
Tap
and scan the RFID basket’s QR code.
Verify that all the items in the RFID basket are displayed on the
Cart
screen.
To add more items to the cart:
Scan the items individually (without placing them in the basket) or,
Add the items to the basket and scan the QR code of the RFID basket again.
Important
Scanning the QR code of the RFID basket
removes all items previously scanned individually
and loads only the items currently in the RFID basket to the cart. If you have scanned the barcodes of individual items,
ensure
that you re-scan them individually, or add them in the basket before scanning the QR code of the RFID basket.
You can now
assign a customer to the cart
and complete the checkout process.
