NewStore now offers a new and improved login flow into Associate App for users who have this feature enabled for their business. Once enabled, associates will notice a faster and efficient login flow in the app, including lower response times and a more seamless navigation within the app.
Important

all devices must be updated to v1.37.0 or later
. Any devices on which the app has not been updated to v1.37.0 or later will
not display
the new login flow for users even if the feature has been enabled for your business.
