Information on how the count zones will be created out of NewStore currently.
You have to split your store into zones by using QR Codes. These zones will then be recorded into your results. To use this feature, generate QR codes with an online tool and set the value of the QR code as "Text". The text value will be the name of your zones, such as
Zone 1
or
Zone 2
.
Note
Associates using the app cannot perform full counts without scanning a zone QR code first.
Click
Create Count
.
The full count entry is now displayed on the
Counts
page in Omnichannel Manager.
Important
The full count entry will have no details until it is activated in the store by the store or count manager on the day of the count. When not activated, the page displays
Full Count Not Active
when the full count is active, products that are part of the count are displayed.
A full count cannot be created if there is a full count that has already been activated. Complete or cancel the active full count, and only then you can create another full count for the store.
Activating a full count
Best practices
The more count zones the better for distributing the workload and checking the variances and recounting zones.
Handover the fulfilled orders before activating the count as they will be included in the stock on hand snapshot. ( Team is evaluating solution ideas to mitigate this).
Activate just before starting the count, as this will get record the baseline stock on hand.
Do not sell or move inventory during the count, as in this first iteration we don’t have enough functionalities to equip the retailers to easily see and adjust the inventory impacts.
Permission required
This action can be performed by users with the Activate full counts permission.
You can activate a full count for inventory in your business via Omnichannel Manager. This will enable the count to be visible and actionable on Associate App in the store.
Important
If not activated, associates in the store cannot see the count and cannot start counting. There is no control over the date and activation. The activation captures the snapshot of the stock on hand in the store.
To activate a full count:
Go to
Store Operations
>
Inventory
>
Counts
.
Find the count you want to activate.
Click
Activate Count
.
The products in the store will be listed with
ProductID
,
Zones
(which are empty by default),
Expected Quantity
,
Counted Quantity
(which are all set to
0
by default) and
Variance
(which is derived by subtracting the
Expected Quantity
from the
Counted Quantity
).
Associates can now start counting, as the active count allows them to start scanning a zone. See
Performing full counts
