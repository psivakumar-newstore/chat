If configured for your business, you can create a custom shipping solution for orders that need custom shipping options. For example, products that need custom shipping based on their weight, dimensions, and price, or orders shipped to a PO Box address. For help with enabling custom shipping options, contact the
support team
.
Before you begin, ensure that:
Your shipping providers and provider rates are configured in NewStore Omnichannel Cloud. For help with this, contact the
support team
.
All provider rates are added to your
fulfillment configuration
. For more information on how to define them, see
Provider rates
.
Your shipping providers are integrated. See
Integrating a shipping provider
.
To retrieve custom shipping options:
To retrieve custom shipping options for orders, develop an
adapter
that implements the
Shipping Options webhooks
. To request custom shipping options for an order, NewStore Omnichannel Cloud must call the
Get customized provider rates
method on your adapter. In the response, send only those provider rates that can be offered for the cart.
To request shipping options for the returned provider rate, NewStore Omnichannel Cloud must call the
Request shipping offers
on your shipping provider adapter. For example, if you work with multiple providers with EasyPost, NewStore Omnichannel Cloud calls your EasyPost adapter for shipping options. See
Integrating a shipping provider
.
Retrieving shipping options for PO Boxes
Note
Ensure that your adapter returns only those provider rates that can deliver to PO Boxes. For example, if you use
USPS_POBox
to deliver only to a PO Box in the US, when NewStore Omnichannel Cloud calls your adapter with a PO BOX in the address, return only
USPS_POBox
. If the address does not contain a PO Box, exclude
USPS
in your response.
Here's how the integration works:
Retrieving custom shipping options for products
Ensure that products are imported with weight, dimensions, and price information.
Ensure that your adapter defines specific provider rates for products that need custom shipping options. For example, if your integrated shipping provider supports provider rates
FedExGround
and
FedExNextDayAir
. Your business offers
FedExNextDayAir
only if the product price is more than
100USD
. When NewStore calls your adapter, include only
FedExNextDayAir
as the provider rate in the response.
:::
Retrieving custom shipping prices for orders
For non-standard orders that need you to offer customized shipping prices, you can set up a custom shipping adapter. NewStore calls the custom shipping adapter using the
Get customized provider rates
method to retrieve the shipping price to use.
Note
Ensure that products are imported with weight, dimensions, and price information.
Important
NewStore uses a shipping offer price based on the value of the
use_as_customer_facing_cost
flag in the
fulfillment configuration
only if:
You have not set up a custom shipping adapter.
The price
source
is not configured in your custom shipping adapter.
The price
source
property in your custom shipping adapter tells NewStore which shipping price needs to be used for these custom orders. You can use one of these values for the price
source
property:
customization_provider
: Use this value when you want to use a shipping price that overrides:
The price configured for the service level in the fulfillment configuration.
The price returned by the shipping provider.
See the response schema for the
Get customized provider rates
method.
For example, you can use a specific price of 50 USD for the provider rate in the custom shipping adapter. NewStore uses this price and ignores any other prices configured in your fulfillment configuration or returned by your shipping provider.
service_level
: Use this value if you want NewStore to:
Use the price configured for the service level in your fulfillment configuration.
Ignore the price returned by the shipping provider.
In this example, the shipping offer price for the service level configured in your fulfillment configuration is 100 USD. NewStore displays this price to the customer, and ignores the prices returned by the shipping provider. See
Tutorial: Setting up a fulfillment configuration (Legacy method)
.
shipping_provider
: Use this value if you want NewStore to:
Use the shipping offer price returned by the shipping provider configured for your business.
Ignore the price configured for the service level in your fulfillment configuration.
In this example, the price returned by the shipping provider is 70 USD. NewStore displays this price to the customer, and ignores the price configured for the service level in your fulfillment configuration. See
Integrating a shipping provider
.
For NewStore to use the correct custom shipping price, ensure that your custom shipping adapter defines the price
source
for products that need custom shipping options. When NewStore calls the adapter, it should return the specific shipping offer prices for provider rates.
For example, if your integrated shipping provider supports a specific price for provider rate
FedExGround
, ensure that this price is configured in the custom shipping adapter. If your business uses the price configured in your fulfillment configuration for provider rate
FedExNextDayAir
, set the price
source
property to use that price.
Note
If the order is split into multiple shipments, NewStore uses a
customized shipping price
.
