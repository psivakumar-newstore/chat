Track order history and recommended products
Clienteling
The Associate App offers a suite of built-in Clienteling functionality that empowers your associates to engage customers in meaningful, relationship building, conversations.
Send customers direct texts, product links, and images, all from the Associate App.
One number shared across the store allows associates to easily keep track of their active conversations or step in to help peers to ensure coverage.
Associates can easily view customer profile data to guide more meaningful interactions.
Loyalty program integration
Retailers can integrate loyalty and rewards programs, enabling customers to earn points for purchases. The system tracks customer transactions and automatically applies rewards and benefits, encouraging repeat purchases and boosting your business.
Integrating external apps
This feature supports integration with third-party apps, such as email marketing or personalized customer data, to further engage customers outside of the store environment.
Retailers can use external tools to create seamless communication channels with these apps to continuously pull data from these sources.
