NewStore platform calculates taxes for in-store orders. As a result, orders will have tax information such as types, rates, and amounts. Tax information retrieval APIs can be used to retrieve the tax transaction created as a result of a tax calculation. This response contains detailed information about tax calculations, including tax exemption information and the taxes applied to an order.
Info
Tax information retrieval APIs can supplement order data with tax details, such as tax exemption class and tax exemption number, which are not available in the event stream.
Note
In this guide, the code snippets contain
{tenant}
,
{env}
, or
{token}
properties.
Use the target tenant for the
{tenant}
property.
Use the target environment for the
{env}
property.
Use your NewStore token retrieved from the Omnichannel Manager console for the
token
property.
Tax information can be retrieved for sales and returns if the tax calculations were performed within the NewStore platform.
Tax information for orders can be retrieved by using the internal order ID of the order:
curl --location 'https://{tenant}.{env}.newstore.net/taxes/transactions/{order_id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
Tax information for returns can be retrieved by using the internal order and the return ID:
curl --location 'https://{tenant}.{env}.newstore.net/taxes/transactions/{order_id}/returns/{return_id}' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
