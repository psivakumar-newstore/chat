The return lifecycle in NewStore is initiated when a customer returns items from an order. The lifecycle is represented by the diagram below using the
BPMN notation
. These concepts are described in the
Business process
section.
This diagram refers to events that are emitted part of the event stream. See the
entity model
and the
webhook
.

When a customer returns items from an order, these returns can be processed in the NewStore platform via NewStore Associate App or an
API
. For more information, see
Returning items
and
Managing returns to a DC
.
When a return is created in the platform, NewStore checks if:
The item(s) returned is eligible for a refund.
The request for the refund is valid.
If any one of the checks fails, the return process fails and the payment refund process is not initiated. To retry the return process, contact the
support team
.
If both checks are successful, the return is successfully processed and the
return.processed
event is emitted. For
blind return
s for orders that originated from an
external order management system
, an external order ID is added to the
return.processed
event.
If all items in an order are returned, the shipping cost for the order is automatically refunded to the customer. The refund is processed when the last item from the order is returned. The shipping cost refund is added automatically to the
total_refund_amount
and related properties in the
return.processed
event.
For more information, see
Automatic shipping cost refunds
.
Important
When shipping costs are refunded, they are indicated in the NewStore platform as returned
line items
with the type specified as
shipping
. These
line items
cannot be mapped to the actual product items that were returned as part of the order.
Before enabling automatic shipping cost refunds, ensure that your current integration can manage such refunds when enabled. Check your integration in a test environment after enabling the feature, before going live.
The
payment refund phase
starts in parallel, and the NewStore platform initiates the necessary payment refund transactions. When these transactions are completed, the
payment_account.amount_refunded
event is emitted. For more information on the payment refund lifecycle at NewStore, see
Refunding the payment or revoking authorization
.
