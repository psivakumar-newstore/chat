Introduction
Configuring Clienteling for your account is a multi-step process, but don’t worry we’ve done this before and we’re here to make sure getting you going is easy as…
Compliance & Regulations:
Every country has different rules around what is required to have a phone number assigned to a business. Generally these come in the form of submitting specific pieces of information, and often times require proof in the form of a government issued document. We’ll help guide you through this process to make sure you’re up and running in the countries you need ASAP.
Adding Stores:
Once you’ve got your regulatory approval for a country it’s time to start adding numbers to stores! Many countries will allow you to add numbers yourself but a few require an additional application to purchase
each
number. The interface will let you know if you’ve run into one of these and we’ll be there to help with that extra step!
Setting up Templates:
Within NOM you can configure a variety of templates that the associates will be able to use while Clienteling to standardize elements of their communication and boost efficiency. At a minimum, you’ll need to set up your “Opt-In Message”. This is the template that gets sent when collecting consent from customers to engage in further Clienteling communications.
Enabling Clienteling for your Business
Existing NewStore customers can request to be enabled for Clienteling
by filling out this Google Form
. In order to complete the form you will need the following information:
The environment(s) you would like to have enabled (generally “Staging”, and/or “Production”).
The specific countries you would like to Clientel within.
Supported countries as well as their respective required information and documentation can be found in the table below. Based on your chosen countries we will reach out for more information in order for us to move forward with meeting regulatory requirements.
Supported Countries & Required Information or Documentation
We provide this table knowing that it is a lot of information to digest all at once. We’re here to help make getting set up around the world easier, please bring your questions with you as we meet, or shoot us an email and we’ll happily guide you through it.

Regulatory Compliance Approvals
Upon submitting the form above
we will reach out to answer any questions and gather the required information as needed for the desired countries (See table above). For customers new to Clienteling we recommend a phased rollout approach that focuses on a specific country and set of Stores. This will allow you to fine-tune and master your Clienteling rollout before attempting a broader launch.
We will work with you in this phase to prioritize the list of desired countries as we submit the required information detailed above in an order that makes the most sense for you. Generally, a regulatory submission will take about a week to process with occasional exceptions.
Once even a single country has been approved we can move on to enabling Clienteling for Stores in that country! We will always be able to come back and add more countries later on as your Clienteling program expands.
Assigning Phone Numbers to Stores
Every Store will receive its own phone number that is shared between the associates working at that location. Stores are configured one by one, assigning a number to the store.
Customers are empowered to assign phone numbers to their stores once they have the necessary compliance approval (discussed above) in the following supported countries:
USA
Canada
United Kingdom
Australia
Germany
Italy
Austria
Poland
Estonia
Denmark
Czech Republic
Finland
Israel
Philippines
South Africa
Hong Kong
Thailand
For stores in other countries, you will need our assistance in purchasing and assigning a phone number to a location, even if you have the regulatory approval for that country. Please open a support ticket and let us know the country and the store you would like to onboard.
Onboarding a Store
To onboard a store for Clienteling:
Go to
Settings
>
Clienteling
, and in the left menu, select
Clienteling stores
.
Click
Onboard a store
.
In the
Onboard a Store to Clienteling
window, from the
Store
drop-down list, select a store.
Verify the phone number displayed in
Store Landline
, where calls from customers will be forwarded. If the number is wrong, please open a support request to update the store’s landline phone number.
From the
Clienteling Number
drop-down list, select the phone number you want to use to send and receive Clienteling messages.
Click
Save
.
The store will be added to the list of those enabled for Clienteling with the selected phone number.
To start Clienteling operations, associates must log out of NewStore Associate App and log in again.
Troubleshooting
Q: There is a warning about compliance
A:
Review the “Supported Countries & Required Information or Documentation” block and submit the relevant information via a support request.
Q: Store does not appear in the Onboard a Store drop-down menu
A:
First check that the store in question has a valid phone number configured. Once a valid phone number is configured to the store it should appear on the
Store
drop-down menu. If the store has a valid phone number and is still not appearing in the
Store
drop-down menu, open a support ticket and indicate the store ID and stage.
Q: No number is shown in the Clienteling Number drop-down menu
A:
If no number is being displayed in the
Clienteling Number
drop-down menu, open a support ticket and indicate the store ID and stage.
Clienteling in Test Environments
We understand the importance of testing in new countries to ensure everything is working as expected before launching more broadly. As such, NewStore supports configuring one Sandbox and one Staging location
per country
. If planning to expand into new geographies we recommend first launching with your test environments and a single production location. Once the end-to-end functionality within a country has been verified, rolling out to other locations is a much simpler operation.
Managing Clienteling Templates
The Opt-in Message
Every SMS communication with a new shopper must begin with collecting an “Opt-in” from the shopper to validate they have agreed to receiving further messages. The “Opt-in Message” is the very first message sent from the Associate App asking for permission. NewStore provides a default message, however you can customize this to better fit your brand messaging as desired.
Important
This is the first message that is sent to the customer, and is crucial to start Clienteling messages from NewStore. Ensure that you know the communication policies for your business before you update the opt-in message.
To update the Opt-in Message:
Go to
Settings
>
Clienteling
, and in the left menu, select
Quick Replies
.
In the
Opt-in request
area, click the opt-in message.
Update the message and click
Save
.
Quick Replies
You can use the NewStore Omnichannel Manager to set up message templates as Quick Replies. Associates can then use these preset messages in Clienteling conversations with shoppers in commonly occurring scenarios such as being busy helping someone in store and needing a moment to reply.
Adding Quick Replies
To add new quick replies to the list of available templates:
Go to
Settings
>
Clienteling
, and in the left menu, select
Quick Replies
.
In the
Quick Replies
area, click the empty dialog box at the bottom of the list.
In
Title
, specify the title of the quick reply and in
Message
, specify the content of the quick reply template.
Click
Save
.
Updating quick replies
To update existing quick replies set up for your business:
Go to
Settings
>
Clienteling
, and in the left menu, select
Quick Replies
.
In the
Quick Replies
area, click the Quick Reply that you want to update.
Update the content specified in
Title
and
Message
as needed and click
Save
.
Deleting quick replies
To delete an existing quick reply set up for your business:
Go to
Settings
>
Clienteling
, and in the left menu, select
Quick Replies
.
In the
Quick Replies
area, click the quick reply that you want to delete and click
Click
Delete Permanently
.
