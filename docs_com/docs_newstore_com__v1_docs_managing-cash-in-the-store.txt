Retailers can use Associate App to process cash payments and refunds within the store and manage and track cash movements within a cash drawer. NewStore allows retailers to choose between two types of cash drawer configurations: integrated and non-integrated.
Setting up cash management in the store
Retailers must first enable the cash management capabilities before setting up the cash drawer configurations within the stores. Enabling cash management is done at the retailer's global level.
Turning on this capability will make options available for setting up and configuring cash drawers within each store via Associate App. While enabling cash management globally makes the capability available to the stores, each store must still complete its specific cash drawer configuration to use all the features.
To enable this feature:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
Set
capabilities
>
cash_management
to true.
After enabling the feature, users can continue configuring stores to use cash management and set up cash drawers using Associate App.
Setting up stores to use cash management
While using Associate App tap
within the App to access cash management. Users with the correct permissions should see the
Cash Management
menu. Retailers should decide which type of cash drawer configuration to use within the store. Stores can only have one type of cash drawer configured within each store location: integrated or non-integrated.
Note
Integrated cash drawers leverage Associate App and its checkout and payment flow to initiate the automatic opening of the cash drawer during sales, refunds, and non-sales transactions.
Non-integrated cash drawers will require the user to physically open the drawer during the checkout and payment flow using a key or other mechanism. Associate app records transactions for each drawer type but only interacts with the opening of integrated cash drawers.
Using integrated cash drawers within a store
Retailers who want to use integrated cash drawers must first ensure they have installed and configured their cash drawers by connecting them to the store network. The cash drawer must be connected to the same WiFi network as Associate App. To learn which integrated cash drawers are supported, refer to the list of supported cash drawers
here
.
To set up and configure the integrated cash drawer, follow these steps:
Connect integrated cash drawer(s) to the same WiFi network as Associate App.
Tap
, and select
Cash Management
.
Tap
Settings
.
Note
When setting up a store for the first time, users will select the
Do not use Cash Management
option under the
Store Operation Mode
. Users must add a drawer type before they can enable
Cash Management
.
Tap
Add an integrated drawer
.
A scanning window appears, scan the barcode on the cash drawer.
Define the drawer name.
Define the recommended cash float for the drawer.
Drawer uses local currency defined for the store.
Save the drawer configuration.
In the
Store Operation
section of the configuration, select
Use Integrated Cash Drawers
.
If the retailer has more than one integrated cash drawer in a single store, repeat steps 1 to 4, and then continue with the daily open process.
Using non-integrated cash drawers within a store
Associate App does not interact with a non-integrated cash drawer to unlock the drawer. However, all transactions are tracked in NewStore, and daily summaries are also available.
To set up and configure the non-integrated cash drawer, follow the steps below:
Tap
, and select
Cash Management
.
Tap
Settings
.
In the
Non-Integrated Drawers
screen tap
Configure non-integrated drawer
.
Define the drawer name.
Define the recommended cash float for the drawer.
Drawer uses local currency defined for the store.
Save the drawer configuration.
In the
Store Operation
section of the configuration, select
Use Non-Integrated Cash Drawers
, and then continue with the daily open process.
Setting up cash rounding
If your business operates retail stores in countries with cash rounding compliance requirements, Associate app can be configured to enable automated cash rounding for all cash sales transactions.
NewStore applies rounding logic based upon the types of coin currencies accepted as payment in the countries where cash rounding is a necessity.
For example, in Australia, there are no penny coins. Depending on the total order amount, the amount due may be rounded up or down to the nearest 5 cent coin.
So the total is
AU $233.87
, the amount due will be rounded up to
AU $233.90
. If the total is
AU $233.86
, the amount due will be rounded down to
AU $233.85
.
Note
The rounding logic is applied when accepting payments for sales transactions in cash and when processing cash refunds when the original form of payment was cash. If the order has a split payment, cash rounding is
only
applied to the cash part of the transaction.
A list of countries where cash rounding is supported is listed below:

To enable cash rounding for your business, see
Enabling cash rounding
.
Important
When you view the order in Omnichannel Manager in
the Order details page
, the amount reflected is not rounded off as in the app.
The rounded off amount is only reflected in the
cash management summary reports
in Omnichannel Manager, as the rounded amount of cash captured for the sales transaction is recorded as part of the cash drawer transaction, and not the actual total amount that was displayed before it was rounded off.
Using the same example as shown above, in the Order details page, the order amount will be displayed as
AU $233.87
but in the cash drawer transaction summary report, it will be displayed as
AU $233.90
.
Configuring non-sale transactions
The available operations can be configured via the
Transaction type API
.
