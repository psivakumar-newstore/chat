Retailers can effortlessly create Automatic Discounts using the NewStore Omni Channel Manager (NOM) platform or via APIs. Once configured, these discounts are seamlessly applied to the customer's cart when it meets the predefined criteria. This automated process streamlines the shopping experience, ensuring customers receive the intended discounts without needing to enter codes or take additional steps.
To enable Coupon discount, configure the following values in the
cart_management_v2
property in
Associate App Config
:
automaticDiscount
To create the automatic promotions in NewStore Omni Channel Manager (NOM), please refer to our
documentation
Unlike the Coupons, creating the Automatic Promotion is a single-step process. The
Create Promotion
enables the creation of automatic coupons with or without any customizable restrictions. Using this API, you can tailor coupons to specific requirements, such as:
Limiting redemption to a specific store
Designating exclusive or non-exclusive offers
Targeting specific customer segments
This flexibility allows for precise control over coupon distribution and redemption.
The HQ team can validate coupons using the Cart Simulator tool within NewStore Omni Channel Manager (NOM). For a comprehensive guide and step-by-step instructions, refer to the
