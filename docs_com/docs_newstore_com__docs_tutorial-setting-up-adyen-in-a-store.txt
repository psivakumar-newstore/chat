The aim of this tutorial is to set up Adyen as a
payment service provider
in a store based in New York City for an imaginary business that has the following characteristics:
One store located in New York City, whose
fulfillment_node_id
is
store1_NYC
.
One payment terminal from Adyen that supports
Adyen Terminal API
. For this tutorial, we will use the
e285
device.
Note
Before getting started with this tutorial, ensure that you have:
Created a store. See
Tutorial: Setting up a store
.
Imported master data in your store and DC. See
Tutorial: Importing products
.
This tutorial is based on the
Adyen Terminal API
, as it is the recommended method to connect Adyen payment devices to the NewStore platform.
Important
This tutorial depends on Adyen setup functionalities. If Adyen changes the setup process, it may take some time for these changes to reflect in this tutorial.
Setting up Adyen
Before you start working with the Adyen payment device to process payments in the store via NewStore, follow this procedure to ensure Adyen can process payments.
To set up Adyen:
Set up a live Adyen account
with the following account structure in Adyen:
Request a merchant account
for each country that your business operates in.
Create stores
for each of these merchant accounts, with the
store_id
representing each physical store that you want to use Adyen in.
In our case, request for 1 merchant account with the ID as
POS_USA
, and create a store with the ID as
store1_NYC
.
Review the finance settings
for payment payouts from Adyen and additional reports to be received for reconciliation.
Note
These reports are different from the payment reports you can generate for your business via NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
(Optional) If needed, you can also set up a
Reserve
fund that you can use for operational expenses and other emergencies.
Order a live payment terminal
or device. In our case, order a new
e285
payment terminal, and a test card.
Important
Test payment devices cannot process live payments. Ensure that you have ordered live payment terminals at least 1 week before you want to start processing payments in your store via Adyen.
Enable the
Adyen Terminal API
and the
notification webhooks
. For more information, see
Webhooks
.
Configure features
for the payment terminal and your merchant or store level account. This includes:
Payment methods
,
capture methods
, and
refund methods
Connectivity
Integrations
Customizations
Manual card entry
Unreferenced refunds
Note
You may have to request the
Adyen POS Support Team
for help with configuring some of these features.
For example, in our case:
Name the terminal as
NYC_1
Set the language for the terminal to
English
Accept payment via credit and debit cards and NFC wallets
Provide refunds to customers via gift cards and the original payment method used by a customer
Mandate a signature from the customer during payment via the terminal and,
Set a maximum transaction amount that the terminal can accept to
50,000
in
USD
.
Also, contact the
Adyen POS Support Team
to enable
unreferenced refunds
and
manual credit card entry
for our
POS_USA
merchant account.
Assign the terminal
to the store.
In our case, from the
Point of sale
section in the
Adyen Customer Area
, assign the terminal
NYC_1
to the store
store1_NYC
.
Note
Terminals recently ordered, but not assigned yet, are listed under the
Inventory
area in the same page. You can also reassign terminals from one store to another if needed.
After the payment device is assigned to the store,
board the terminal
.
Note
Ensure the terminal is connected to the internet.
Boarding connects the terminal to the store and the Adyen server, and makes it ready to accept payments.
Verify that the terminal works as intended. See the
e285
quickstart guide
for details on setting up the
NYC_1
terminal we just boarded.
Add a new API credential
for your merchant account and assign the
POS Terminal Management API
role to it in the
Adyen Customer Area
.
(Optional)
:
Add more users in the
Adyen Customer Area
to work with the Adyen integration if needed. See
Manage users
.
Update your local integration
to reflect the IP address of the live terminal
NYC_1
. See.
To
test the integration
with the terminal, make a low-value (
USD 1
) payment on the
NYC_1
terminal in the store.
In the
Adyen Customer Area
, verify that the
PSP reference
history for the payment shows the following transition:
Received
>
Authorised
>
Settled
.
(Optional) Refund the payment to validate the refund process.
You have now successfully set up the
NYC_1
payment terminal in the New York City store.
Next, we will ensure that the device works with the NewStore platform.
Setting up NewStore to process payments via Adyen
To set up NewStore to process payments via Adyen, follow these steps to validate that NewStore Associate App can use the
NYC_1
Adyen payment terminal you have set up for your New York City store.
Install NewStore Associate App.
Ensure that you are assigned to the
store1_NYC
store via NewStore Omnichannel Manager. See
Managing users and roles
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
Connect the terminal and NewStore Associate App to the same Wi-Fi network in the store.
To view the assigned payment terminal in the store, in NewStore Associate App, tap
>
Credit Card Terminal
.
The terminal
NYC_1
appears in the list.
During checkout, select
Credit Card
and select
NYC_1
as the terminal, and tap
Connect to Terminal
.
Adyen is now set up in your New york City store and you can use
NYC_1
(the
e285
device) to process payments.
Additional steps for integration
To resolve errors with payment devices or terminals when setting up Adyen or NewStore, see
Troubleshooting: Payment devices
.
Depending on your business, you may have to configure Adyen additionally to work with NewStore platform features like NewStore Checkout.
To integrate NewStore Checkout with your business, see
Adyen integration for NewStore Checkout
.
