Configuring a global exclusion list
You can create a list of products that must never be discounted during a purchase. For example, products like gift cards and carry bags are never discounted by a retailer.
Products in the exclusion list will not be discounted when an order discount, an item discount, or a coupon code is applied to the cart. Automatic promotions cannot be applied to these products either.
To check the current list of global excluded products for your business, use the
Get promotions config
method.
To modify a list of global excluded products:
Use the
Update promotions config
, or
delete promotions config
method.
For updating the list, in the
ids
property, specify a list of product IDs to which no discounts or promotions can be applied during checkout.
Configuring reason codes for manual discounts and price overrides
You can create a list of reason codes for manual discounts and price overrides. Associates can use these to specify reasons to offer manual discounts to a customer. If no reason codes are specified for a given catalog, the Associate App will display a free text field to enter the reason for the discount. You can configure the reason codes when offering manual discounts on:
The whole cart or order, or
Individual items
Note
This feature is not available when the Associate App is offline.
To view the list of reason codes, use the
List reason codes
method.
To create a new reason code:
Use the
Create reason codes
method.
Specify a code for the reason in
code
and a relevant name in
name
.
For example,
dmgd
and
Damaged
for manual discounts to be offered on damaged or defected items in the store.
These reasons will be available in the app for the associate when offering manual discounts to the customer. See
Adding discounts and redeeming coupons
.
Important
Ensure that the value defined in the
Accept-Language
property matches the locale set for the store.
To display a free-text field for associates to enter a custom reason, ensure that you
do not
create a reason code for the store's specified locale.
To update a reason code, use the
Update reason code
method.
To delete a reason code, use the
Delete reason codes
method.
