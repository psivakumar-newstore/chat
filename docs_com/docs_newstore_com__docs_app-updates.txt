Bug fixes üêû
Returns
This fix resolves an issue which prevented returns to be completed in specific scenarios in the app.
Release v1.66.0
Release date
: July 7, 2025
We're excited to introduce Associate App v1.66.0, which delivers breakthrough capabilities to elevate customer service and support item level inventory management. This release introduces two powerful early access features: Reservations, enabling associates to hold products for customers who need time to complete their purchase, and RFID Checkout, connecting Checkpoint RFID readers directly to iOS devices for seamless product identification and enhanced inventory accuracy.
We've also enhanced the checkout and return experience by displaying Electronic Product Codes (EPC) throughout these workflows, giving associates confidence that the right items are being processed. Additionally, store search functionality has been improved when adding delivery addresses, reducing navigation time in stores with extensive location networks.
These enhancements reflect our commitment to empowering store teams with advanced tools that improve customer experiences while building the foundation for next-generation inventory management.
New Features
üéâ
Early Access: Reservations
Store Associates now have the ability to reserve products for customers who show strong purchase intent but prefer to complete the transaction later - not currently available or planning a later visit. This creates a premium, personalized shopper experience where high-value or limited items are held exclusively for a set timeframe (typically ¬†24 or 48 hours), shielded from other in-store or omnichannel demand.
This feature is in Early Access. Contact your Omnichannel Success Manager to have it enabled in your stores.
Early Access: RFID Checkout
Retailers can now connect a Checkpoint RFID CPiD 400 POS reader to Associate App, enabling product identification through RFID tags and capturing the Electronic Product Code (EPC) for integration with downstream RFID solutions. This supports a smoother checkout experience for store teams and enhances overall inventory accuracy.
This feature is in Early Access. Contact your Omnichannel Success Manager to have it enabled in your stores.
Improvements
üí™
EPC displayed throughout ¬†the checkout flow
Store Associates can now view the Electronic Product Code (EPC) of products scanned or read via the RFID reader directly in the cart. This ensures confidence during checkout, confirming that the item in hand matches the one being sold‚Äîsupporting accurate and reliable inventory records.
Available after upgrade, no setup required.
EPC displayed throughout the return flow
Store Associates can now view the Electronic Product Code (EPC) of previously purchased items during returns. By matching the EPC in the app with the last four digits on the product‚Äôs RFID tag, they can verify the correct item is being returned‚Äîsupporting item-level accuracy in inventory.
Search for stores when adding delivery address
Store associates can now search on store name or address when adding a store as a shipping address. This reduces scroll time and ensures a smooth experience when there is a high store count.
Release v1.65.0
Release date
: June 16, 2025
This release brings a focused update that improves search performance and simplifies customer management workflows for a smoother user experience:
Multi-select filtering on the
Product Listing
page now lets associates select multiple values per attribute‚Äîlike size, color, or category‚Äîmaking it easier to find inventory faster and more precisely.
We've also improved address creation to reduce data entry time when managing customer profiles.
Behind the scenes, we‚Äôve resolved several stability issues to support smoother daily operations‚Äîincluding fixes for remote cart sharing, product scanning, and Quick Add-to-Cart workflows.
New Features
üéâ
Multi-Select Filters on the Product Detail Page
Associates can now apply multiple filter values simultaneously in the
Product Listing Page
, making it easier than ever to narrow down inventory with precision.
Need to find all size 9 shoes in both black and white? Previously, this required running two separate searches. With multi-select filters, associates can now choose multiple values for each attribute‚Äîlike color, size, or category‚Äîin a single search. This significantly speeds up the process of finding the right products.
Available after upgrade, no setup required.
Improvements
üí™
Expedited address creation
To save associates time when creating new addresses on customer profiles, existing customer names and phone numbers now automatically populate in the new address input fields. This enhancement eliminates redundant data entry and accelerates the customer service process.

Release date

Retailers in Italy can now apply tax exemptions, offering tax relief to specific groups, such as diplomats or special economic zones, thus enhancing shopper satisfaction and ensuring tax compliance. Retailers can configure the tax exemption categories and codes to comply with these regulations and update them when they are revised by the tax authorities.

Release v1.52.0
Release date
: July 22, 2024
In this release, we've enhanced the Runner feature to support sales floor replenishment, allowing associates to specify quantities and differentiate between try-on and replenishment requests, and expanded support for the popular Star printers, including models TSP 100IV SK and MCP31CI.

Improvements
üí™
Sales floor replenishment requests via Runner
We've enhanced the Runner feature to support sales floor replenishment! Sales associates can now specify quantities and differentiate between try-on requests and replenishment requests. This upgrade helps retailers increase product availability on the floor, ensuring subsequent shoppers find the products they love, ultimately boosting the sales conversion rate.
Available after upgrade, no setup required.
Expanded support for Star printers
We are happy to announce expanded support for more Star printer models, including the TSP 100IV SK, MCP31CI, MCP31CBI, and BSC10II.

Application configuration updates
üí°
New Discretionary Discount screens
To enhance self-service and ease of use, we are ensuring all retailers who are currently using discretionary discounts will effortlessly receive the new screens and capabilities.
The
Add Discount
screen will now be divided into two new screens:
Discount
screen: for applying discounts on orders and items.
Price Override
screen: for setting a new (lower) sales price on an item.
Additionally, you can now set up your own predefined reason codes and labels by following the steps in
our documentation
to enable associates to select predefined reasons for discounts or price overrides, streamlining the process and reducing the need for manual entries.
Enabling Buy in Store / Ship to Store
With the Buy in Store / Ship to Store omnichannel flow now validated as part of the last release, we have shifted the feature to a
capability toggle
rather than a
release toggle
in the
Associate App configuration API
. If you were an early adopter, no action is needed, the
release toggle
will continue to enable the feature for you.
We will deprecate the
release toggle
in favor of the
capability toggle
in a future release. Retailers currently using the
release toggle
, or those who haven't adopted this omnichannel flow should use the
capability toggle
with this release.
For guidance on setting the
capabilities toggle
to enable this feature, see the documentation of the
Update Associate App configuration
endpoint.
End of Life

Release v1.51.0
Release date
: July 1, 2024
In this release, we've added granular payment methods for external payments for better reconciliation visibility, and timely sales dashboards for near real-time sales data. Enhancements include improved messaging for carton-level receiving to reduce support tickets, continuous scanning of successive cartons for streamlined receiving, and improved error handling for remote carts to prevent mistakes and increase efficiency.
Improvements
üí™
Granular payment methods for external payments
Retailers using the external payments option can now define specific, granular payment methods and expose those within the app. This added flexibility and granularity provides retailers with better reconciliation visibility and tracking within NewStore and their ERP platforms.
To take advantage of this new capability, see
Configuring payment options
.
Retailers currently using external payments, and those who do not need additional payment method granularity, do not have to make changes to their existing configurations.
Timely sales dashboards
Store reporting allows associates and store teams to see refreshed sales report data within a few minutes of an order being placed. These dashboards help them track sales metrics throughout the day. This is the first of a series of planned updates to improve in-store sales reporting. This improvement does not change the timeliness of Omnichannel Insights in Omnichannel Manager.
Available in v1.51.0 as well as previous app versions, no setup required
Improved messaging for carton-level receiving for missing products
We have improved error messaging so associates can see when ASNs have failed. For example, when a product is missing from the catalog because of a technical issue, the app prompts the associate to retry.
Available after upgrade, no setup required
Continuous scanning of successive cartons
If the associate receives a message after scanning, they can promptly continue scanning other cartons, minimizing friction and speeding up the receiving process.
Available after upgrade, no setup required
Improved error handling for remote carts
This update ensures associates are alerted with an error message if a remote cart cannot be created, preventing potential mistakes by avoiding the unintentional filling of in-store carts with items meant for remote carts.
Available after upgrade, no setup required
Bug fixes üêû
Scanning
Associates can now scan inventory using iPad in landscape mode
Keyboard no longer blocks scanning modal dialog
Release v1.50.2
Release date
: June 13, 2024
The previous patch, v1.50.1, fixed a bug preventing offline catalog usage. However, it introduced a rare issue causing the scanning spinner to stay visible when the offline catalog database is corrupted.
As we are unsure how many offline catalog databases may be affected, we therefore feel it is safer to release another patch v1.50.2 to address this issue.
If you are currently using versions v1.50.0 or v1.50.1, please upgrade to v1.50.2 immediately to avoid potential disruptions. Earlier versions are unaffected.
Our team will monitor the app closely over the weekend. If you encounter any issues, rest assured that full support is available.
Bug fixes üêû
Scanner
Corrupt offline catalog data no longer causes an infinite loading spinner during scanning
Release v1.50.1
Release date
: June 13, 2024
Associate App v1.50.1 addresses a bug that is blocking the use of the offline catalog, preventing associates from checking downloaded product data. Offline mode is still functional, and scanning in both online and offline modes continues to work with the live catalog.
This is not a critical patch, relating only to the use of offline catalog, and need only be applied at the retailers' discretion. No functional changes are included.

Release v1.50.0
Release date
: June 10, 2024
Our latest release is focused on empowering associates and enhancing the customer experience. From enabling ship-to-store options in endless aisle to streamlining international sales with commercial invoices, we're making omnichannel transactions smoother than ever. We've also added smart enhancements like pre-set discount reasons to speed up checkout, while personalizing customer interactions with tailored name entry fields. These updates, along with key bug fixes, reflect our commitment to making every store interaction faster and easier.
New Features
üéâ
Buy in Store and Ship to Store
Associates can now select nearby store locations as delivery options directly within the endless aisle checkout flow. Stores are sorted by proximity, making shipping to the current store a breeze. By removing delivery costs when store pickup is convenient, this new fulfillment option can drive incremental omnichannel sales. Customers receive the same timely notifications as with standard endless aisle orders, keeping them updated on when their item ships and arrives at their chosen store for pickup.
Additionally, we've enhanced usability by displaying the delivery address in the cart view for all endless aisle and mixed cart orders, providing clearer order information at a glance.
Retailers can enable this feature by setting the release toggle
ship_to_store_enabled
to
true
via the
Associate App Configuration API
.
Improvements
üí™
Streamlined Discounts and Price Adjustments with Pre-Set Reasons
Retailers can now predefine a list of specific reasons for discretionary discounts and price overrides. Associates simply select from these standardized options, eliminating manual typing during checkout. This feature not only saves time but also ensures consistency in reason codes. This results in faster transactions, reduced keying errors, and robust data for more accurate discount tracking and trend analysis.
While this new capability works seamlessly with automatic promotions and coupons, it does not work alongside the existing discounting.
Retailers can start using this by following these 3 steps:
Enable reason codes
Enable price overrides
Define discount and price override reason codes
Commercial Invoices for International Store Fulfillment
To streamline international sales, we've introduced commercial invoices‚Äîa critical customs document‚Äîto our store fulfillment process. Associates can now easily download and print these invoices, which serve as detailed declarations for goods crossing borders. This addition ensures smooth customs clearance, facilitating seamless international transactions right from your stores.
To configure commercial invoices, see
Configuring documents to be generated and printed for orders
.
Tailored Customer Name Entry
Early Access
If you are interested in early access to this feature, ask your point of contact at NewStore or contact your Omnichannel Success Manager to enable this feature for you.
Retailers can now personalize how customer names are captured and displayed across our platform. Choose between a traditional first-name/last-name format or a modern single-field full-name entry. This flexible option, available in both the new customer screens of the Associate App and Omnichannel Manager, ensures a consistent, brand-aligned experience that respects diverse naming conventions and retailer preference.
By default, the new customer screens use the full name. If you would like early access to the feature that allows switching to using the first name and last name separately, contact your Omnichannel Success Manager.
Increased Ease of Switching Users on a Device
Associates use a number of different devices during the day, and they need to switch quickly between them and log in when helping a customer. To speed up this switching process, we have included a new button at the bottom of the PIN Login screen to make this easier and more intuitive.
Available after upgrade, no setup required.
Smart Printer Organization: Receipts vs. Documents
We've restructured our printer selection interface, clearly separating receipts from all other document types. This organization reflects how associates typically use printers: one dedicated to frequent receipt printing, others for varied documents like shipping labels and invoices. This intuitive layout enables associates to quickly identify and set preferred printers for each task.
Available after an upgrade, no setup required.
Bug fixes üêû
Blank spaces for an empty contact phone number on endless aisle orders are no longer accepted

Improvements üí™
Optimized receipt printing from default printers
Setting a default printer in the printer management settings significantly speeds up the transaction process for printing a receipt. This feature ensures that receipts are automatically printed from the pre-selected default printer, eliminating the need for associates to choose a printer manually for each transaction.
Epson POS printer support
Epson is one of the biggest POS manufacturers in the US and is used worldwide. We have extended our framework to include their
POS printers
, giving retailers more options.
Split payment error reduction enhancements
Store associates sometimes encounter situations where shoppers change their minds mid-transaction. If the payment has already been processed, going back within the Associate App does not reverse the payments, which can result in payments being made without orders. With this new release, associates will receive in-app guidance on how to continue and complete the transaction. They will also be guided on how to process returns and refunds to reverse payments.
Accurate active sort on product listing page
When accessing the sorting options on the product listing page, the interface suggested that a sorting method was already applied. This was purely a visual indication and did not reflect the actual sorting state. With the new update, the sorting screen will now correctly display the active sorting state when you open it, ensuring a more intuitive navigation experience.
Improved login error messages
Error messages related to user login have been improved. They now give clearer instructions about what the problem is and actionable steps to solve the issue.
Enhanced flow for assigning customers to a cart
We have streamlined the process of assigning existing customers to a cart, which optimizes workflow efficiency. Associates can now seamlessly search and assign existing customers to a cart without additional navigation steps.
When creating a new profile in the cart screen, navigate to the customer screen and tap
New Customer > Enter details > Save > Assign to Cart
to assign the customer to the cart. When a customer is assigned, the associate is automatically redirected to the cart and can continue the checkout process. This removes the need for extra navigation steps for the associate.
End of life notice
Deprecation of Adyen classic library terminal integration
In alignment with Ayden's end-of-life announcement for their Classic Library terminal integration (March 31, 2024), NewStore will no longer offer or support this integration method. All retailers must now use Adyen Terminal API when connecting payment terminals with the NewStore POS application.

Release v1.46.0
Release date
: March 19, 2024
Associate App version 1.46.0 marks a leap forward in enhancing the user experience and operational efficiency. We're introducing the highly anticipated iPad landscape mode, offering unparalleled flexibility in device utilization for sales support and as stationary tills in retail settings. This version also brings features and improvements geared towards streamlining operations and enhancing communication.
New features üéâ
iPad landscape support
The iPad has become an important part of our product offering, with more than 30% of users currently running the Associate App on iPad. It is commonly used as a fixed station or to enhance customer interaction with rich product displays. With growing adoption, we decided to improve the iPad user experience, beginning with the introduction of iPad landscape. This allows the associate to use the iPad in both orientations, taking advantage of the additional screen real estate.
Select and fulfill specific orders
Associates can now pinpoint and fulfill specific orders, using the order ID, prioritizing customer-escalated or VIP orders needing swift attention, enhancing store fulfillment efficiency and flexibility.
Improvements üí™
Two-way communication between runner and associate
Runners and associates can now exchange updates on product availability or response times, facilitating efficient communication. Previously, associates could leave instructions for runners but now the conversation can go both ways.
With just a tap on the notes field, the runner or associate can type a message and hit send and the app will notify the other. All notes are neatly organized on the notes page, separated for clarity.
Dictation can be used instead of typing, so the users can save time.
Additionally, we've introduced a 'new note added' notification feature that is turned on by default. Once activated in settings, runners and sales associates will be promptly notified of the new note, to ensure swift and effective communication.
New cash operation flows
The updated cash sale, refund, and non-sale transaction flows are now available to all users. After validating with early adopters, we are confident this improves the reliability and overall experience while processing and managing cash and interacting with integrated cash drawers. This is now enabled automatically but can be disabled via
configurations
if you choose to do so.
This new flow is enabled by default for all retailers who have not explicitly set the cash management release toggle to false.
Tap to pay on iPhone - faster transactions
Leveraging the latest Adyen SDK, this new version provides performance improvements on backend communications, resulting in faster overall payment processing speeds. This also enables further support for more geographies once those become available.
Enhanced checkout error messages
We now provide associates with more descriptive and helpful error messages when encountering problems during the checkout process. Users now receive better guidance when encountering issues such as coupon redemption, applying promotions, fiscalization, and processing returns. With increased clarity, associates are now guided on what actions to take to address the issue.

Improvements
App Customization Enhancements
Date picker widget
Associate App customization widgets can now include a Date Picker component. This enhancement allows retailers to expand the customer profile, enabling associates to capture significant dates like birthdays, anniversaries, or other important events in various formats. The feature accommodates both full and partial date inputs, making it possible to collect just the month and day (for birthdays) or the year and month (for subscription start dates), among others. These settings can be adjusted in the Omnichannel Manager by navigating to
Settings

Default attributes for customizations
In order to make Widgets and Webviews more powerful, every slot will now receive additional properties to make the current store, associate and cart available when creating customizations. The associate ID, store ID and the cart ID if available can be utilized to provide greater context to the app extension. See
Using data in a webview component
.
Multiple tokens for external integrations
Customizations for Associate App are now supporting more than one PostLoginCallbackUrl, which is needed for authentication against third-party services. Partners and integrators are now able to build multiple integrations using WebViews. See
Retrieving external authentication information
.
Additional Enhancements
Inventory management user permissions
3 new user permissions have been introduced to give retailers more control over the inventory management functions available to store associates:
View Inventory Management
Perform Counts
Adjust Inventory
These permissions have been added to all existing roles with Associate App access so that current users can continue to perform these actions. The roles can be easily updated as desired in Omnichannel Manager and will take effect upon the next user login with email and password.
Important
Review the roles available in your business for Associate App to ensure that all users have appropriate access, before you upgrade to v1.45.0.
Faster Scanning with Barcode Scanners
Scanning products using a barcode scanner from the cart view (
Quick Scan
) is now faster and less error prone. Previously, there was an intentional delay in
Quick Scan
to prevent the same item from being scanned more than once. Based upon user feedback, there is no longer a delay when scanning products using the barcode scanner, improving the overall experience.
Tax Breakdown Generally Available
Tax breakdown is now available to all users and is no longer controlled by the tax exemption feature toggle, enabling associates to assist shoppers more effectively when there are inquiries about the taxes being charged.
Show/Hide images on the PLP
Based on feedback we‚Äôve learned there‚Äôs two paths to approaching a Product Listing Page. In some cases, an overview with plenty of importation and images is needed. At other times, or with a different products scope, getting as much products as possible displayed on the PLP is preferred. With that, the Show images toggle was born!
Important
The
Show images
button can be enabled by an associate at any time in the app. The default behavior is to display images for products.
Offline prices enabled by default
Offline prices are now enabled by default as part of the offline catalog backup configuration. This ensures that retailers do not need to worry about different configurations and have it enabled as soon as offline catalog data is configured.

Runner
product card.

Store associates no longer need to manually enter prices when scanning barcodes or entering the UPC. This enhancement will provide a more user-friendly and time-saving experience when transacting in Offline Mode. They will continue to see the product name and the flexibility to modify prices as required, ensuring that the final pricing remains accurate.

Tax breakdown
Countries, states, counties and cities can have different taxes and it can be a challenge for the sales associate to explain when shoppers inquire by during checkout, since the cart only shows the total tax amount.
Sales associates are now equipped with the tax breakdown, enabling them to assist shoppers more effectively when inquired about the taxes being charged. As the associate taps on the
Taxes
summary line on the cart, the tax breakdown will be visible. It is now possible to see the state, city and special taxes with the percentages and amounts, along with the net and gross amounts of the order. Below the order tax breakdown, associates can see the tax breakdown per item.

Tab navigation for store fulfillment
In our latest update, we've improved the way associates multi-task and navigate within Store Fulfillment. Switching between tasks like finding orders and fulfillment is seamless and efficient, eliminating the hassle of repetitive backtracking. With the introduction of intuitive tab navigation, similar to the experience in the Selling section of the Associate App, associates can move through tasks with ease and familiarity. This update simplifies their workflow and lays the groundwork for exciting future enhancements like contextual insights and gamification.
Brighten up the fulfillment flow 2.0
We've upgraded our store fulfillment process to enhance efficiency and user experience. Product caching in
Search Order
,
Picking
, and
Packing
screens streamlines operations. For situations where pending information, like customer details, previously lacked clear feedback, we've implemented improvements to provide a smoother and more informative loading experience.
We've also simplified the mispicking process with intuitively arranged
Confirm
and
Cancel
buttons. The
Handover Details
button has been repositioned in the
Carrier Pickup
section for better accessibility. For single-item orders, the
Print
button consistently stays at the bottom of the screen for easier access. Similarly, the
Confirm Handover
button is now more conveniently accessible.
Improved transparency on transfer document generation errors
Occasionally, the generation of transfer documents may encounter errors because of missing configuration, the carrier site not being responsive, or other reasons. Associates will now see the reason the transfer documents cannot be generated so they are able to resolve. In future releases, the error messages will be enhanced to improve the user experience even further.
Specific refund options for external order management
NewStore has a number of retailers using an external OMS to handle their orders and fulfillment requests. For most of them, the external OMS manages and processes refund requests with the payment provider.
With this release, retailers can now display refund options in the app that are specific to external OMS configurations. This new capability simplifies the refund process for associates by removing refund options that do not apply to specific transactions.
We have also enhanced the blind return functionality for external OMS orders to offer retailers more flexibility when issuing refunds. Associates can now refund to credit cards as well as issue new gift cards when performing a blind return.
Improved integrated cash drawer performance and reliability
This release includes performance and reliability enhancements in Cash Management as well as some new transactional flows for non-sale transactions. This includes new scanning capabilities and flows that enhance communication with integrated cash drawers, reducing user interactions within the app. This in turn provides faster and more reliable scanning of the integrated cash drawer and improved navigation.
In the new non-sale cash management flow:
The scanner screen overlays on the existing screen, improving user experience.
The new scanner framework now is used for both sales and non-sales transactions, making communication with the drawer super fast!
"Pairing" is now replaced with just a single act of scanning the drawer, which immediately opens the drawer.
Non-sale transactions are now included in a dropdown overlay on the existing screen, allowing associates to quickly select non-sale transactions and reason codes.
Enable this feature via the
Config App API
