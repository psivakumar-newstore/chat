Use the business process models to understand how various processes work at NewStore and how you can integrate with each of them.
These diagrams use the
BPMN notation
and rely on other concepts such as order routing or payment processing.
These models refer to events that are emitted as part of the Event Stream. See the
entity model
and the
Event Stream webhook
.
You can open
.bpmn
files used in this section with
Camunda Modeler
.
To install it, run:
brew cask install camunda-modeler
