Use these configurations to set up checkout operations in the NewStore platform, including checkout via Associate App.
Configuring gift wrapping
You can enable gift wrapping to be available during checkout in the Associate App. You can also specify the price and the tax code for gift wrapping.
To configure gift wrapping for your business:
Use the
Update checkout configuration
method.
In the
value
>
gift_wrapping
property":
Set
message_enabled
to
true
, if you want to enable customers or associates to add a custom message with the gift order.
In
price
, specify the price that will be added to the order if gift wrapping is added. The price inherits the currency that is specified for the cart.
In
tax_code
, specify the tax code that will be associated with gift wrapping.
Enabling manager approval
You can specify if certain orders or items need
approvals
from store managers or other associates in the Associate App before checkout.
To enable manager approvals in the Associate App:
Use the
Update checkout configuration
method.
Set
enable_manager_approval
to
true
.
Important
Manager approval is not applied to clienteling transactions. Transactions that have not been initiated via clienteling will continue to use manager approval rules, but these rules are not enforced for clienteling transactions.
In addition, if there is an automatic coupon or promotion applied to an order in the app, manager approval rules are not triggered.
Let's take an example of an automated discount: “winter jackets for 30% off”. Let's suppose there is also a manager approval rule for discounts of 20% and higher. In this case, the manager approval is NOT triggered. The automatic promotion takes priority.
Configuring manager approval rules
You can configure the rules that trigger manager approvals in the Associate App.
The following criteria are available for approval rules:
Criterion Name
Type
Description
has_discount
Boolean
Specifies if a discount will be applied on the order or item.
has_tax_exemption
Boolean
Specifies if orders with tax exemption need approval in the Associate App.
is_return
Boolean
Specifies if all returns will need approval in the Associate App.
is_blind_return
Boolean
Specifies if all blind returns will need approval in the Associate App.
discount_value
Number
Specifies a fixed value for the discount. Discounts on orders that equal or exceed this value need approval in the Associate App.
discount_percentage
Number
Specifies a percentage value for the discount. Discount percentages that equal or exceed this value need approval in the Associate App.
refund_value
Number
Specifies a fixed value for a refund. Refunds for orders that equal or exceed this value need approval in the Associate App.
order_value
Number
Specifies if orders that equal or exceed a certain value need approval in the Associate App.
discount_level
order
or
item
Specifies if the discount is on an order or on an item.
payment_method
Array
Specifies certain payment methods that need approval in the Associate App.
To see the list of approval rules set up, use the
List approval rules
method.
To create a new approval rule:
Use the
Create approval rule
method.
In
label
, specify the name of the manager approval rule.
In
description
, provide a description of the manager approval rule. For example,
Discounts equal or above 50%
.
In
criteria
:
Specify if the order or item will contain a discount. In
name
, specify
has_discount
, and in
value
, specify
true
if the order or item will contain a discount.
For all possible values, see the
table
entries with the
Type
as
Boolean
.
Specify the criterion for the discount. For example:
In
name
, specify
discount_percentage
. In
value
, specify the percentage value for the discount. Discount percentages that equal or exceed this value need approval in the Associate App.
For example, specify
50
to ensure that all orders with discount of 50% or more need approval in the Associate App.
For a list of possible criteria that you can specify here, see the
table
.
Specify if the discount will be applied on an order or an item.
In
name
, specify
discount_level
and in
value
specify
order
for order-level discounts and
item
for discounts to be applied on an item in an order.
To update an existing approval rule, use the
Update approval rule
method.
Deleting manager approval rules
To delete a manager approval set up for your business, use the
Delete approval rule
method.
Accepting imported orders without verifying service levels
You can configure legacy OMS or e-comm orders to be imported into the NewStore platform without verifying if the shipping option or
service level
defined for the order can be offered.
For such orders,
soft allocations
are not assigned. If there is insufficient stock for the order or the shipping options specified are unavailable, the order is automatically canceled. Manage such orders separately via the external OMS. You cannot manage these orders via Omnichannel Manager.
To accept imported orders without verifying the associated service levels:
Use the
Update checkout configuration
method.
Set
skip_soft_routing_on_injection
to
true
.
Limiting the number of items on an in-store order
You can set the maximum number of items an in-store order can contain. For that, use the
big_sales_order.hard_limit_for_big_orders
property of the
Checkout configuration API
. By default its value is 100.
Important
Do not set the
hard_limit_for_big_orders
property to a number higher than 240. Order placement may fail. For transactions where there are more than 240 items, we recommend splitting the transaction into smaller transactions, each with less than 240 items.
