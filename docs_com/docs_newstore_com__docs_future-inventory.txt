Future inventory
You can use
future inventory
to forecast and fulfill orders on a future date. NewStore includes future inventory when calculating stock on hand and ATP for products at each fulfillment location.
Important
NewStore only supports importing future inventory into warehouses or DCs, and not stores.
When setting up
pre-orders
for your business, use future inventory to determine the number of products that can be sold as pre-orders before the product becomes available for sale. See
Managing pre-orders
.
In NewStore, you can set future inventory at a fulfillment location using a
stock import
. During a stock import, specify the quantity and date for the future inventory at a specified fulfillment location. In each stock import, you can specify either the current
stock on hand
or future inventory to import for a product, not both. Run two import jobs to import both stock on hand and future inventory for a product.
For more information, See
Importing data
or the
tutorial
.
Note
You can import future inventory only as the
future ATP
for the product in the fulfillment location.
Items in inventory transactions such as receiving and transfers, created against shipment references (ASN) or purchase orders (PO), can also be considered as future inventory for the destination location. If you are expecting items in the warehouse from such inventory operations, and want to specify them as future inventory, set future inventory using an import job.
Once the items are received, they are added to the stock on hand for the fulfillment location and are not considered as future inventory anymore.
Future allocations
If you have set up pre-orders for your business, you can use
future allocation
s against
future inventory
to set aside items at a specific fulfillment location, to fulfill these orders on a future date.
When an order is placed in the NewStore platform with pre-ordered items, a future allocation is created if future inventory is available for the product at the fulfillment location. The status of the pre-ordered items changes to
Pending
in NewStore Omnichannel Manager. If no future inventory is available for the product, the status of the pre-ordered items changes to
On Hold
.
For more information on managing future inventory, see
Importing data
or the
tutorial
.
When the pre-ordered products become available for sale, the future allocations become regular allocations. The pre-ordered items are routed and fulfilled based on the inventory available at the specified fulfillment location. This includes future inventory that you have specified for import on that date at the location.
Note
NewStore only supports importing future inventory into warehouses or DCs, and not stores. Therefore,
future allocation
s are not applicable for store fulfillment.
For more information about managing pre-orders, see
