Contains information about new functionalities and updates made in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
July 2025
Release Date
:
July 18, 2025
Fulfilment node auto-creation during store setup
Simplified store onboarding flow by introducing automatic creation of Fulfilment Nodes when a store is created via the
Store HTTP API
. Previously, integrators had to manually create a fulfillment node after creating a store using a custom JSON payload. This added complexity, increased risk of misconfiguration, and created unnecessary support effort.
With this change:
A fulfillment node is automatically created with the same ID as the store ID when calling the POST /stores API.
This behavior applies only to retailers where the store ID and fulfilment node ID are intended to match.
Why this change is important:
Reduces store setup time and onboarding complexity
Minimizes integration errors due to missing or mismatched fulfilment nodes
Decreases support load and resolution time
How to adopt:
This behavior is enabled by default for existing retailers where the fulfilment node ID already matches the store ID, and for all new retailer tenants moving forward.
For existing retailers requiring custom Fulfilment Node IDs, the current behavior will remain unchanged and is controlled via an internal list.
If you require fulfillment node IDs that differ from store IDs, this feature does not apply. Contact your Omnichannel Success Manager for support.
Release Date
:
July 17, 2025
Hourly automatic rerouting for on-hold orders (insufficient inventory)
Automatic rerouting now proactively attempts to re-route on-hold orders (due to insufficient inventory) once per hour. Previously, rerouting occurred only when a positive ATP change was detected.
With this update, rerouting will occur:
Hourly, even if ATP has not changed
When a positive ATP change is detected
Why this change is important:
This enhancement improves timely fulfillment for eligible orders by accounting for changes beyond inventory updates, including:
Store capacity updates
Stores becoming unblocked or re-enabled
Resolution of fulfillment constraints that are unrelated to ATP
How to adopt:
If you are already using automatic rerouting, no further action is required. The hourly behavior will apply automatically.
If you are not yet using automatic rerouting, see these pages for more details:
About order routing ‚Üí Optional automatic rerouting
Monitoring orders ‚Üí Automatically routing on-hold orders
Configuring order routing settings
To enable automatic rerouting, use the
Automatic Rerouting configuration API

Easypost errors visible for On Hold orders
Retail Operations can now view the Easypost errors directly in the Activity section of the Sales Order Detail page. This offers instant insight into the root cause of orders placed On Hold due to shipment-related exceptions.
May 2025
Release Date
:
May 21, 2025
Improved UPC Handling Logic in Omnichannel Insights
To improve the accuracy and consistency of Universal Product Code (UPC) attribution across tenants, the Business Intelligence team has updated the UPC derivation logic in the
Activities
model. The updated logic now pulls the UPC from
external_identifier
first, then looks at the
extended_attributes
second. This change addresses missing UPCs for some retailers.
Why this change is important:
Improved Consistency:
Prioritizing
external_identifier
aligns better with integrator and retailer expectations
Better Reporting & Analytics:
Ensures that Omni Insights reflects the most accurate and authoritative UPC data source.
How to adopt:
No action is required from end users. All reports automatically reflect the new logic.
April 2025
Release Date

The new
Template - Returns Insights
dashboard is available as a Template dashboard in Omnichannel Insights. This dashboard provides retailers with actionable visibility into their in-store returns.
Access the dashboard from
Omnichannel Insights
and use filters to drill down into top return reasons, return trends over time and more.

Inspect and replay rejected events in Event Stream
Release date:
April 14, 2025
NewStore‚Äôs Event Stream enables real-time data flow for key business events. This includes order creation, return processing, or fulfillment request assignment, which power third party systems through webhooks or AWS S3 integrations.
With this release, you can now inspect and replay rejected events - a major step forward in helping retailers monitor and troubleshoot integration issues independently.
From the
Rejected Events
page in the Omnichannel Manager (NOM), you can:
Inspect
: View a detailed payload of any rejected event. This allows technical users to understand what went wrong, including any discrepancies in the data or integration target.
Replay
: After inspecting, you can manually trigger a re-delivery attempt for the event to the original destination without requiring a separate API call.
This functionality is especially helpful when events fail due to transient network issues, incorrect mappings, or endpoint misconfigurations that have since been resolved.
To use this feature, navigate to
NOM > Tools > Event Stream > Actions > View Rejected Events
(requires the
View Tools
permission), and look for the
Inspect & Replay
button against each listed event.
To learn more, see the
Event Stream documentation
.

Release date
: April 4, 2025

.
BORIS Uplift Update - Insights Reporting
Release date
: February 18, 2025
The measurement of Bought Online, Returned In Store (BORIS) Uplift now tracks returns at the item level instead of the order level.
Previously, BORIS Uplift was measured only on the final return date of an order, even if an order had multiple return dates. This update shifts the calculation to track returns at an item level, ensuring that every uplift happening at different return day is accounted for. Each in-store purchase on a return day is recorded, giving a complete view of recoup activity for orders with multiple return dates.
Bug fixes üêû

Configure historical orders and web returns for the Sales Dashboard
Release date
: September 25, 2024
Headquarters now have expanded options to customize NewStore Associate App's Sales Dashboard to ensure that sales metrics match their business-specific data requirements.

Insights
>
Associate App Setup

Simulate the behavior of coupon codes and promotions
The
Cart Simulator
in Omnichannel Manager allows Campaign Managers to experiment with and validate promotions and coupons. You can simulate the behavior by adding products to a hypothetical cart and applying a coupon code to the cart. The

, and
Sale Catalog Keywords
. Additionally, the
Template - Daily Sales
report includes two new widgets:

April 2024
View order properties of a payment
Omnichannel Insights did not allow seeing sale properties of a payment. This made it difficult to analyze payments based on sales details like country code, sale location, or channel type. To fix this, payments data is now a new activity type in the
Activities
data model.
Order data is now combined with payments data. This combination allows new use cases, such as separating payment service provider identifiers by store country code, or pulling cash payments by store.
To try this in Omnichannel Manager, go to
Insights
>
Explore
>
Search Data
. Choose the
Activities
worksheet and paste
Activity Type Activity Date = yesterday unique count Order
into the search bar. This shows you the number of each activity type from yesterday, now including payments received.
The
Template - Payment Details
report in Omnichannel Insights is leveraging Activities.
To adopt the new payments data in your custom reporting, navigate to
Insights
>
Explore
>
Search Data
, and type
Payments
in the left panel under
Find Columns
. The payments fields that were previously available in the
Payments Worksheet
are now available prefixed with the word
Payment
. However, we now include
Activity Date
to report in store local time, as well as
Transaction Amount
converted to AUD, GBP, USD, CAD, and EUR.
Mispick and mispack data for store fulfillment orders
Retailers can now view data around mispicks and mispacks for all orders that have been fulfilled from stores across their business. This includes a pre-defined reason for why an item(s) was mispicked or mispacked.
See
Specifying reasons for mispicked or mispacked items
.
March 2024
Permissions to close ASN
Release date
: March 27, 2024
Retailers can now grant a specific permission to authorize roles to be able to force close ASNs. See
Force closing an ASN
.
Create cycle counts for selected stores
Release date
: March 21, 2024
NewStore has improved the feature of creating cycle counts for all stores. Retailers now can use Omnichannel Manager to create cycle counts for the same list of products across all stores in a specific country, or a selected list of stores.
New base currency rates available in Insights
Release date
: March 14, 2024
To understand the performance across multiple stores that operate with different currencies, all transactions have to be converted to a single base currency. Until now Insights only supported USD base currency. However, many retailers requested to see the reports in their operating currency.
Starting from this release,
Sale Net
value,
Return Net
value and
Shipment Net
value are available in USD, AUD, CAD, EUR and GBP currencies. All local currency amounts can be converted to the 5 base currencies above.
Read the documentation of how to change the currency
.
February 2024
Force Closing an ASN
The name of the button on the ASN detail page has been changed to
Force Close ASN
and the confirmation dialog explains the impact of the action (that it will not receive any further shipments but will close the ASN). The identifier of the user who force closed an ASN is now displayed in the page.
Personalized views in Omnichannel Insights
Personalized views allow you to save your own set of values for filters and parameters in a liveboard without editing the original liveboard. You can change the values of the already present filters and parameters in a liveboard and save the view for future use.
Personalized views bring the following benefits:
You can set filters once to a liveboard and save them as a personalized view. This saves repeated steps.
The last used personalized view is now automatically applied when refreshing a liveboard. This saves time in not having to re-enter store-specific filters after every refresh.
Manage a single dashboard across regions with personalized views pre-created by store, country, or region. This simplifies report creation for stores or regions.
The following permissions apply:
Liveboard editors in
Insights
>
Explore
can make multiple personalized views for others to use by selecting "Make view available to all users". In this case, users who can access that liveboard can use the views as well.
Liveboard viewers in
Insights
>
Reports
can only create personalized views for themselves.
BORIS uplift metrics
The new buy-online-return-in-store (BORIS) uplift metrics show how much BORIS boosts your business. Omnichannel Insights finds when a shopper has visited a store to return a web purchase and purchased something else at any store in the same day. This allows for calculating the value of items purchased on the same day as a BORIS action.
Access the BORIS uplift metrics under
Template
>
Omnichannel dashboard
.
Confirm data freshness in Omnichannel Insights
You can now check the data freshness in reports by looking at the
Last Data Refresh in Minutes
widget on the
Daily Sales
dashboard. This can partially address concerns of store managers who want to close out their day, but cannot do so until confirming that all orders are incorporated into the sales dashboard.
To use the new
Last Data Refresh in Minutes
widget, pin it to an existing sales dashboard, or make a new copy of the
Template - Daily Sales
.
New customization component for Associate App available: Date picker
Omnichannel Manager now allows to set up customization widgets with
Date picker
components. Head to
Associate App
>
Customizations
and start exploring it! Create customization widgets that allow your associate to collect birth dates from your customers or track any other date in different formats. This feature allows you to configure different parts of a date to be stored in certain formats. Examples for this could be to collect just month and day (for birth dates) or just the year and month (for when a subscription should start). The format in which this information is stored can be defined using a letter-based pattern. Learn more about the exact format
here
.
Shipment Associate Name
Omnichannel Insights has additional data available. It is now possible to report on the associate who marked an order as handed over. This can be empty when a carrier picks up an item and no associate is marked during handover. The
Shipment Associate Name
is now available in the
Activities
worksheet in order to understand who handed an order over to the carrier. Note that this does not mean that associate picked or packed that order.
Fiscal stores
Retailers can now view stores in fiscal countries along with their fiscal status in
Settings
>
Fiscalization
>
Fiscal Stores
page.
You can now use Omnichannel Manager to manage fiscal store activation, including features such as cashbox activation and fiscal status monitoring upon activation.

New out-of-the-box dashboards
The
Customer Dashboard
announced in December
is now available to all retailers.
The
Store and Associate Performance Dashboard
is a default report in Omnichannel Insights, which enables a quick comparison between top and bottom performing stores and associates based on sales, activities, and discounts.
Comparing associates within the same store allows for targeted training and performance incentives, fostering a competitive yet collaborative environment. On the other hand, assessing different store locations provides valuable insights into regional variations, helping retailers refine marketing strategies, inventory management, and tailor customer experiences to local preferences.
New data available in Omnichannel Insights
There are new data fields available in the
Activities
data model in Omnichannel Insights to support multiple new use cases:
View Returns and Fulfillment reports based on geographical location.
Report all activities by store or Distribution Center in Omnichannel Insights.
Local reporting time for Sale, Return, Reject, Shipment and Discount.
Calculate fulfillment value in a simple way.
View Returns and Fulfillments based on location across activities in Omnichannel Insights. This allows building a report such as viewing all return countries by the country an item was sold from.
New fields include City, State, Country Code, Timezone, and Zip Code for both Returns and Fulfillments.
Filter out all store or distribution center activities from any report with the new
Activity Location Type
field. For example, when filtering any report by
Activity Location Type = store
, this will only show events that occur where a store was involved.
It is now possible to create a single report by Sale, Return, Rejection, Shipment, and Discount date times for all timezones without using the
Timezone Offset
. Previously, it was possible to create regional reports for these dates by using the
Timezone Offset
, which is no longer required by using the localized date time fields.
New fields added for
Sale Order Date
,
Return Date
,
Rejection Date
,
Shipment Date
, and
Discount Date
. All reflect the date time that the activity occurred, which is localized to the sale/return/discount/rejection/discount location. If no location information is available, they default to a predetermined tenant timezone.
It is now possible to sum the value of what was fulfilled. Previously, this required a sub-query in Omnichannel Insights. Three new fields have been added to allow this reporting:
Shipment Price Net
Shipment Price Net USD
Shipment Price Tax
Reporting in USD is now available for today
Before this change, USD-converted rates were only available after market close. Now
Sales Price Net USD
, and
Return Refund Net USD
will use the previous day exchange rates until the new rates become available. When new rates become available, the USD values will update and change to the new and most recent rates at market close.
Update shipping addresses
Users with the
Manage order exceptions
permission
can now adjust an order's shipping address information
for store fulfillment orders in case of a shipping address-related shipment booking error that prevents the shipping label from being generated and printed. The update can be done in Omnichannel Manager to generate the shipping label in the Associate App successfully.
ovide a fixed amount as a refund for items in an order to appease customers. For more information, see
Refunding orders or items in an order
