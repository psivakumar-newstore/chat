Enabling cycle counting
To enable cycle counting on Associate App:
Use this
configuration
method.
Specify the store IDs or a wild card
*
value for the
enabled_counts_stores
property.
Configuring manual quantity updates
You can allow associates to adjust the counted items in the inventory manually. This feature is enabled by default for all retailers.
To enable manual quantity updates for counted items across stores in your business:
For Associate App, use this
configuration
method.
Specify the value for the
allow_counts_manual_quantity_editing
property as
true
.
Enabling a cycle count after a mispick or mispack
When associates specify that an order cannot be fulfilled, a
cycle count
sheet containing these products is created automatically for the store. Associates can then use the count sheet to count the
stock on hand
for these products in the store.
This ensures that the accurate stock on hand for the products is displayed in NewStore Omnichannel Manager.
To enable NewStore to automatically create a cycle count after a mispick or mispack in the store:
Use the
Set inventory configuration API
.
Specify the value for the
create_cycle_count_after_mispack
and
create_cycle_count_after_mispick
properties as
true
.
Note
This feature is disabled for all retailers by default, and the default value for these properties is
false
.
