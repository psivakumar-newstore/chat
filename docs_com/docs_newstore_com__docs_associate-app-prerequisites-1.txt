We recommend that your store has the following prerequisites in place:
Networks and stable WiFi
Ensure that you have separate networks; one dedicated to retail operations and another one for sound and digital signage. We recommend that you not allow guest access to these networks.
Ensure that you check network requirements for Adyen. See
Adyen's guidelines
.
The iPhone running the app must be connected to the same network as the document and/or label printer.
A bandwidth of more than 4Mbps per app. Note that maximum bandwidth is used for catalog browsing.
A round trip latency of less than 500ms, at full bandwidth per app.
A backup option if you have problems with your WiFi connectivity. For example, additional backup SIM cards with LTE/4G connectivity if you face Internet or power outages.
The wireless access points at your stores are mounted or installed so you have minimal interference from nearby networks within range.
Store WiFi with signal strength at:
-65dBm (Acceptable) across the whole store.
-50dBm (Optimal) for core checkout spaces in the store.
Test the signal strength against the expected peak number of active apps in the store, at any given time.
Domain names
Ensure that you whitelist these domain names in the respective environments.
Important
NewStore recommends you to use naming conventions such as:
<retailer_name>.p.newstore.net
,
<retailer_name-staging>.p.newstore.net
, or
<retailer_name-sandbox>.p.newstore.net
for your tenant clusters.

Printers
The document printer(s) must be AirPrint compatible. We recommend default wired connections to your printers. The iPhone running the app must be connected to the same network as the document and/or label printer. For a complete list of AirPrint-compatible printers, see the
Apple website
.
For more information on printer models that are supported by Associate App, see
Supported printers
.
Note
For recommended label paper dimensions, See
Setting up a printer
.
Bluetooth
If your store uses bluetooth payment devices from Square that are connected to NewStore Associate App, ensure you enable bluetooth on the smartphone running the app.
Note
Each Square payment device can only be connected to 1 iPhone at a time.
(Optional)
TouchID-capable smartphone
Using a TouchID-capable smartphone adds an additional layer of security and allows the user to personalize the device. TouchID can be setup in the settings of your device.
Recommended printer setup
Note
You can add multiple printers. If a default printing station is not defined, the app uses the first printer in the list. Also see
Setting your default printing station
.
NewStore recommends the following printing station setup:
Receipt printing station
Located on the sales floor, this printing station should contain only one document printer.
Document and label printing station(s)
Separate printing station(s) named sequentially, for example
floor1
,
floor2
.
Each of these stations should contain one document printer and one label printer.
