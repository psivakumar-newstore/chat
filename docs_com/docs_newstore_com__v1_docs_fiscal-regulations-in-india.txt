Receipts for stores
Based on regulations that apply to stores operating in India, these additional features must be included in the receipts:
All receipts must have a consecutive receipt number, in one or multiple series.
The organization's name, address and GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax identification number) must be displayed in the header of the receipt.
HSN code of goods or the Services Accounting Code (SAC) must be displayed for each item.
For items exchanged by the customer, separate sales and return receipts with unique receipt numbers must be generated.
All receipts must have a breakdown of taxes, payment method(s), date/time of the transaction in India timezone (IST).
To modify the receipt templates for India, see
Customizing a template
.
Important
NewStore platform provides fiscal transaction information that is required to be printed in fiscal receipts. It is responsibility of the retailer to ensure compliance of the receipt templates with the local fiscal regulations.
Consecutive receipt numbers
According to the fiscal regulations in India, each receipt must contain a consecutive receipt number. NewStore platform generates consecutive receipt numbers for each transaction based on the transaction type and the configured receipt number prefix.
The consecutive receipt number is made of 4 parts:
The type of the transaction, where
S
and
R
stand for
Sale
and
Return
respectively.
The fiscal year in which the transaction was created, in
YY
format.
A configurable unique receipt number prefix that will be used within the receipt series.
The receipt number prefix must be configured during the
fiscal activation
.
A unique value per store is recommended for the receipt number prefix.
The maximum length of the receipt number prefix is 5 characters.
A consecutive transaction number.
The consecutive transaction number is incremented per type of transaction.
Important
According to the fiscal regulations in India, the fiscal year starts on April 1st.
For example, in the calendar year of 2024, the fiscal year will be 2023 until March 31st, and 2024 from April 1st.
At the beginning of each fiscal year, on April 1st, the consecutive transaction number will be reset.
The maximum length of the consecutive receipt number is 16 characters.
As a result, the number of transactions that can be created in a fiscal year depends on the length of the configured receipt number prefix. This means that the longer the receipt number prefix is, the fewer digits there are for the consecutive receipt number.
For example:
For a receipt number prefix that consist of 3 characters, the receipt series will accommodate up to 99,999,999 transactions in a given fiscal year.
For a receipt number prefix that consist of 5 characters, the receipt series will accommodate up to 999,999 transactions in a given fiscal year.
