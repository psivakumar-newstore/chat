The first step in using NewStore as your omnichannel services and mPOS platform is to set stores and warehouses in the platform. This allows you to configure physical locations to manage inventory, and optimize your order fulfillment processes.
Once you have set up your stores and warehouses in NewStore, you can use the following features of the platform:
Store configuration
: Define store locations, operating hours, and stock availability to ensure efficient order routing and inventory visibility.
Warehouse management
: Set up warehouse locations, storage capacities, and processing times to enhance inventory accuracy and optimize stock levels.
Inventory management
: Monitor and manage inventory across all stores and warehouses in real-time, preventing lost sales and overstocking.
Order routing
: Automatically route orders to the nearest store or warehouse based on inventory and location, reducing shipping times and costs.
Use an external OMS
: Use an external OMS to manage orders in your business in tandem with NewStore, and import historical orders that were placed before switching to NewStore.
Setting everything up allows you to use Associate App and Omnichannel Manager to manage inventory and store operations seamlessly without having to use APIs.
