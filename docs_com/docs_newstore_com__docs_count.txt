Module 3: Store inventory management (Part 1)
Use
Enabling cycle counting
documentation to enable count feature
Inventory counting is essential for maintaining accuracy. We use two methods:
Full count
: A comprehensive physical count of all inventory items in a store or warehouse. Typically performed annually or during audits, full counts provide a complete inventory snapshot.
Cycle count
: A targeted count focusing on specific product categories, locations, or high-value items. Conducted on a recurring schedule, cycle counts help identify discrepancies and maintain ongoing accuracy.
Creating a count task
To initiate an inventory count, you can use either Omnichannel Manager or the
Create Count Task
API.
Completing the count task
Once a count task is created, store associates can use the Associate App to start and complete the count. If NewStore manages inventory, the on-hand quantity updates immediately upon completion, and Available-to-Promise (ATP) is recalculated accordingly.
Important
Refer to the
Managing store operations
section for
creating a cycle count
and
full count
sections to understand the creating cycle count task in Omnichannel Manager.
For creating counts via API, use
Create Count Task
API.
A complete count of all the items in a store, imported from a count file into NewStore Omnichannel Cloud. A full count for a store is usually done once or twice a year. See
