Permission Required
This action can be performed by users with the Manage discounts permission.

Note
Automatic promotions are always applied before coupons and manual discounts for an order, when all of them are applicable to an order.

Apply
. The list of coupons will be filtered by entities such as the coupon name or coupon code, status of the coupon, active or disabled coupons and so on.

Type
: Specifies the type of coupon, such as applied to the whole cart (

Last Updated

Planned
: The coupon has been enabled, but is not valid yet, and cannot be applied in NewStore Associate App. Based on the
Starts
date, the coupon becomes valid and its status automatically changes to

.
Past
: The coupon is past its end date, and can no longer be applied to any orders.
Running
: The coupon has been enabled and is currently valid on the NewStore platform. The coupon is applied during checkout in NewStore Associate App to orders that meet the coupon criteria.
Creating a coupon
You can create coupons that are either applied to the whole cart in NewStore Associate App, or to specific products or categories in your business.
When multiple coupons apply to the same product, the coupons are calculated and applied in the following sequence:
coupons for specific products are applied before coupons for the whole cart are applied.
Percentage discounts are applied before fixed amount discounts.
Buy X Get Y
coupons are applied after product and cart coupons.
BXGY coupons with a percentage discount are applied
before
BXGY coupons with fixed amount discounts. For two BXGY coupons with the same type of discount, the one with a higher discount is applied first.
Important
You cannot change the type of a coupon after it has been created.
If you want to import large quantity of codes, do not provide a single large file. Instead, split it into multiple files, each containing 50,000–100,000 entries, to prevent system overload.

Buy X Get Y coupon example
When you create a BXGY coupon in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, the discount will not be applied directly to only one item in the order. The coupon is distributed across the item that you buy and the item that is eligible for the discount. This allows you to process a return for any of the items that were part of a BXGY coupon, and provide a refund to the customer.
For example, you create a coupon for
Item A ($100)
and
Item B ($50)
, where the customer buys
Item A
and gets a
100% discount ($50 discount)
on
Item B
.
In this scenario, the discount is applied to both items and not just to
Item B
.
To calculate the discount for each item, NewStore uses this ratio:
ratio = discount/(price of Item A + price of Item B)
In this example, the ratio is
50/150 = 0.33
.
NewStore then multiplies the ratio with the original price of each item. In this example, the discount for each item is calculated as:
Discount on
Item A
:
0.33 * $100 = $33.4
Discount on
Item B
:
0.33 * $50 = $16.6
The total discount is computed as
$50
for the BXGY coupon.
If the customer wants to returns an item, the refund will be processed based on the discounted price of the item.
