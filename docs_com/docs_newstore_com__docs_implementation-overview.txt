Introduction
This document provides an overview of how to implement NewStore’s platform using a phased approach, tailored to support both retailers and partners. It outlines the core capabilities and integration touchpoints across each phase, enabling organizations to follow a structured strategy that minimizes risk and maximizes time to value.
NewStore’s modular architecture supports the rapid deployment of foundational features, with the flexibility to scale into more advanced omnichannel capabilities as the business evolves.
By structuring the implementation into clearly defined phases, retailers can:
Reduce operational risk
Accelerate time to value
Align technical workstreams with business readiness and change management
Why use a phased approach
While some retailers choose a "big bang" implementation, where all features go live simultaneously, most prefer a phased rollout due to its flexibility and reduced risk. Key advantages of the phased model include:
Faster time to value
: Core features like product catalog, payments, and order management can be brought online quickly, enabling early value realization.
Lower operational risk
: By rolling out in controlled phases, issues can be isolated and resolved before affecting broader operations.
Iterative learning
: Retailers can gather feedback from store teams and customers in early phases to refine later rollouts.
Land and expand strategy
: Allows organizations to launch with core use cases (e.g., POS, basic returns) and expand into more advanced functionality (e.g., endless aisle, remote selling, clienteling) as adoption matures.

Note
In addition to native capabilities, NewStore also offers accelerators for certain integrations that are not supported natively by the platform. These accelerators, developed by our Expert Services team, are designed to accelerate implementation timelines and reduce overall effort. They are available for an additional cost. Contact your NewStore point of contact for more information.
Phasing strategy
NewStore platform is
modular
, so based on a retailer's priorities, capabilities, and appetite, the
phasing strategy can be adjusted
. A typical roll-out strategy is mentioned below.
Phase 1: Core POS
Product Catalog & Pricing
Payment Integration
Cash and Carry, Returns, and Exchanges
Cash Management
Analytics / Reporting
Tax Configuration
Shipping Setup (for Inventory Management)
Email Receipts
Coupons and Automatic Promotions
Customer Profiles
Phase 2: POS+
Store Inventory Management, including adjustments, counts, transfers, and receiving
Loyalty
Customer Data in CRM
Phase 3: Omnichannel and Order Management
Endless Aisle / Mixed Cart
eCom Orders
Omni Exchanges
Omni Gift Cards
Buy Online, Return In Store
Historical Order Injection
360 Degree view of Customer
Real-Time Inventory Visibility for DC
Clienteling & Remote Selling
Phase 4: Omnichannel +
Real-Time Inventory Visibility Across all stores and DC
BOPIS (Buy Online, Pick Up In Store), Ship-from-Store, and Ship-to-Store
Shipping Setup (for Ship-from/to-Store)
Pre-orders

Big bang vs. phased: choosing the right path
When planning an implementation with NewStore, one of the key strategic decisions is whether to adopt a
big bang
approach or a
phased
rollout. Each path has its merits and risks, and the right choice depends on your organization's resources, timelines, technical readiness, and appetite for change.
Big bang approach
In a big bang rollout, all integrations, features, and system touchpoints go live at once, often across multiple stores, regions, or channels.
Pros:
Unified go-live
: All systems and teams are aligned on a single cutover date.
Faster time to full platform utilization
: No delays between feature rollouts.
Clean transition
: Easier to sunset legacy systems in one go.
Cons:
Higher risk
: Any issues can impact all operations across channels and locations.
Heavy upfront preparation
: Requires full integration, testing, training, and change management readiness across the board.
Resource intensive
: Demands deep involvement from all stakeholder teams simultaneously (IT, operations, training, support, etc.).
Best for:
Retailers with centralized IT and operations
Organizations with firm end-of-life deadlines for legacy platforms
Businesses operating in a single region or with limited store counts
Phased rollout approach
A phased rollout introduces the platform in incremental stages, typically starting with core POS and inventory, then expanding into more complex and omnichannel capabilities over time.
Pros
:
Lower operational risk
: Smaller, focused launches reduce the impact of potential issues.
Faster value delivery
: Enables use of key features while later phases are still in development.
Flexible scaling
: Teams can adjust based on lessons learned and capacity.
Smoother change management
: Allows gradual adaptation for store staff and internal teams.
Cons:
Requires coordination
: Needs strong alignment across phases to ensure continuity.
May require interim workarounds
: Some capabilities might be temporarily unavailable until a later phase.
Best for:
Multi-region or multi-brand retailers
Teams with limited resources or staggered availability
Brands following a "land and expand" strategy
Recommendation
At NewStore, we generally recommend the phased approach, especially for retailers with complex backend systems or large store networks. It offers a balanced path to deployment with reduced risk and more manageable execution.
However, for retailers with high alignment, dedicated resourcing, and a tight timeline, we’re fully equipped to support a big bang approach as well.
