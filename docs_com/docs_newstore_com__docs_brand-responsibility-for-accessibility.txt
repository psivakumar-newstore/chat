Retailer's contribution is essential to ensure your Shopping App is accessible and compliant. Hence, we advise you to review your responsibilities as a brand and act accordingly.
Disclaimer:
This table provides guidance on key accessibility responsibilities but is not intended as an exhaustive or comprehensive list of all accessibility requirements. Retailers remain solely responsible for ensuring their Shopping App meets all applicable accessibility standards, including but not limited to WCAG guidelines, ADA compliance, and other relevant legal requirements. NewStore makes no warranties regarding the completeness of this guidance.

Brand Identity and Theming
: Changes to the brand identity are exclusive retailer responsibility. NewStore will not alter a retailer brand and visual imaginery. Theming changes require retailer input and sign-off. The Expert Services and Design team role is to ensure implementation quality.
If you encounter limitations or issues with accessibility, submit an insight via the Roadmap Portal in Studio or NewStore Omnichannel Manager, or contact your Omnichannel Success Manager or Support.
