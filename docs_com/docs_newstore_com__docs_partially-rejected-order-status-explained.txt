This document defines the
'Partially Rejected'
and
'Mispick'
item-level statuses, outlining their roles within the
Order
processing workflow.
It also explains scenarios where mixed item statuses, such as
'Mispick'
or
'Routing'
, appear in partially rejected orders and how these statuses integrate into the overall processing lifecycle.
The image above shows a partially rejected order, where one item is marked as 'Mispick' and another is in 'Routing' status.
Since both items are part of the same
Fulfillment request
, the item marked as 'Mispick' (product_id 1000682) will remain in this status until the item in 'Routing' (product_id 1000071) is either
Shipped
,
Canceled
, or also
Rejected/Mispicked
. Once product_id 1000071 is processed, product_id 1000682 will be either automatically rerouted or placed on hold if no stock is available.
Note
: Even if product_id 1000071 is in 'Accepted' status, product_id 1000682 will stay in 'Mispick' status until product_id 1000071 reaches one of the final statuses mentioned above.
