Important
For documents or labels to be printed in a store, ensure that the store is added to the fulfillment configuration. See the
API resource
for updating the fulfillment configuration for the retailer.
You can specify the following when configuring documents to print in the store or warehouse:
The document to print. NewStore supports
invoice
,
packing_slip
,
return_form
,
shipping_label
,
return_label
, and
in_store_pickup_label
. For more information, see the notes below.
The number of copies to print.
The type of printer you want to use. Configure documents to be printed using
document_printer
and labels to be printed using
label_printer
. For more information, see the notes below.
Send push notifications to the customer's email address.
Send push notifications to the customer's mobile device, using the customer's UUID.
Important
If you specify that a
return_label
should be printed among the documents, NewStore books a return shipment by default when booking the delivery for an order.
NewStore does not book a return shipment and does not print a
return_label
for international shipments.
NewStore
does not
support printing more than one page on label printers. If you use the label printer to print documents other than labels, such as transfer packing slips, ensure that it is a 1-page document.
Note
NewStore supports either the
shipping_label
or the
in_store_pickup_label
for an order. You cannot print both labels for the same order.
You do not have to print the
return_label
for orders that are picked up in store.
If a store or DC does not have a label printer, you can print labels using the document printer. To do this, specify the printer type for labels as
document_printer
when specifying the type of printer for such labels.
During
store fulfillment
or inventory
transfer
s, documents can be printed in
A5
paper size if required. For example, when printing labels for the
Sagawa
shipping adapter in Japan.
Only PDF documents can be printed in
A5
paper size. Ensure that the orientation of the paper is landscape when printing the labels.
Document and label printers print fulfillment documents in alphabetical order.
To configure documents to print, see the following sections.
Configuring documents to print for inventory operations
You can configure documents to print for inventory operations across your business or for specific stores or warehouses. This configuration allows you to print shipping labels and transfer packing labels with the printers set up in your store or warehouse.
To view the current configuration for printing inventory related documents in your business, use the
Get retailer inventory configuration
method.
To update the configuration to print inventory related documents for your business:
Use the
Update retailer inventory configuration
method.
In the
documents_to_print
property, specify the following:
To print shipping labels, in the
shipping_label
property, specify the following:
In
copies
, specify the number of copies that a print action generates from the printer.
In
printer_type
, specify the type of printer to use for printing shipping labels. For example, specify
label_printer
to use the label printer.
To print the transfer packing labels, in the
transfer_packing_list
property, specify the following:
In
copies
, specify the number of copies that a print action generates from the printer.
In
printer_type
, specify the type of printer to use for printing the transfer packing lists. For example, specify
document_printer
to use the document printer.
Important
For retailers that have the new printer framework turned on, associates must configure
Printer Settings
and assign the
Transfer Packing List
document type to the relevant printer.
(Optional) Use the
documents_to_print_by_node
property to set up a printing configuration for specific fulfillment locations in your business.
Specify the
fulfillment_node_id
for each fulfillment location that you want to set up the configuration for, and specify the values for the
shipping_label
and
transfer_packing_list
properties for each of these locations.
Use the
Set retailer inventory configuration
method to activate the updated inventory configuration and start using the new printing configuration for your business.

fiscal regulations

is required to print sales receipts in the stores.
