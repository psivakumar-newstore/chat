In your sync with the retail operations team you demo the return flow in the Associate app using the item condition damaged and show in the
NOM Store Operations Inventory view
that the item was added to the damaged location. A check in the
NOM Stock levels view
confirms that the ATP for the item hasn’t increased. Everybody is happy with the result until somebody raises a question: “How do we correct mistakes in case the item is good to be sold after all?”
Not a problem at all and the perfect time to introduce Inventory Adjustments. You explain that the associate who spotted the mistake can adjust the item back into main to add it to the store ATP easily by processing an adjustment with the right adjustment reason.
You start with the preparation of the store you have created in
Module 1 - Foundational Setup
and enable that store to be managed by NewStore:
Important
Configuration process:
Set up an adjustment reason → you can learn how to setup adjustment reasons and more by reading this page:
Configuring inventory adjustment settings
the adjustment should have
damaged
as the origin location and
main
as the destination location
make sure that
enabled_adjustments_stores
is enabled for all stores in the inventory management feature config
With that adjustment reason in place you can process an adjustment transaction and check the result in the
NOM Store Operations Inventory view
. To wrap up the module, export the audit trails for the item for both locations main and damaged.
Congratulations for completing Module 3!
