Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
Retailers must first enable the cash management capabilities before setting up the cash drawer configurations within the stores. Enabling cash management is done at the retailer's global level.
Turning on this capability will make options available for setting up and configuring cash drawers within each store via Associate App. While enabling cash management globally makes the capability available to the stores, each store must still complete its specific cash drawer configuration to use all the features.
Enabling cash management globally
This enables cash management globally for your business, across all stores configured to use NewStore Associate App. This feature also enables users to set up cash drawers via NewStore Associate App.
To enable cash management:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
Set
capabilities
>
cash_management
to true.
Configuring cash management settings
After enabling the feature, users can continue configuring stores to use cash management and set up cash drawers using Associate App. See
in this article
how to do that.
After this feature is enabled, users can add cash drawers via Associate App.
Setting up stores to use cash management
While using Associate App tap
within the App to access cash management. Users with the correct permissions should see the
Cash Management
menu. Retailers should decide which type of cash drawer configuration to use within the store. Stores can only have one type of cash drawer configured within each store location: integrated or non-integrated.
Note
Integrated cash drawers leverage Associate App and its checkout and payment flow to initiate the automatic opening of the cash drawer during sales, refunds, and non-sales transactions.
Non-integrated cash drawers will require the user to physically open the drawer during the checkout and payment flow using a key or other mechanism. Associate app records transactions for each drawer type but only interacts with the opening of integrated cash drawers.
Using integrated cash drawers within a store
Retailers who want to use integrated cash drawers must first ensure they have installed and configured their cash drawers by connecting them to the store network. The cash drawer must be connected to the same WiFi network as Associate App. To learn which integrated cash drawers are supported, refer to the list of supported cash drawers

.
To set up and configure the integrated cash drawer, follow these steps:
Connect integrated cash drawer(s) to the same WiFi network as Associate App.
