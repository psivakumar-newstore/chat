When using NewStore's Order Management System, you'll manage how orders are routed for fulfillment. You can rely on default routing, where the system selects the best fulfillment location, or use prerouting to specify a location yourself. Factors like the shipping address, inventory levels, and delivery options influence the routing. The system also supports advanced settings such as split shipments, rerouting, and handling store capacity. This ensures orders are fulfilled efficiently based on your specific needs.
Important

.
To enable NewStore to inject orders and transmit work orders to the Distribution Center (DC), the following basic platform configurations are mandatory:
Carrier Configuration: Define carrier options and settings to facilitate shipping and delivery.
Define Service Levels: Establish
Service level
options to dictate
Order
fulfillment speeds.
Add Routing Configuration: Configure routing rules to direct orders to the appropriate DC.
By completing these essential configurations, you will enable NewStore to seamlessly inject orders and send work orders to the DC, ensuring efficient and effective order fulfillment.
Carrier Config
The NewStore platform automatically requests shipping offers from the carrier during the injection process. However, if necessary, this step can be postponed and performed immediately before routing. Nevertheless, the NewStore platform must generate the shipping offers before the order is routed to ensure a seamless and efficient shipping process.
Note
The tutorial for configuring the Carriers can be found

.
For DCs, Easy Post/shipment config is optional since shipments are handled outside NewStore.

Service levels
Service levels are established to facilitate the mapping of shipment speeds to corresponding carrier service levels. NewStore supports
Provider rate
priorities, enabling retailers to configure multiple carriers for each service level. This ensures redundancy and flexibility in case a primary carrier is unable to support a specific service address or is unavailable. In such scenarios, the platform automatically defaults to the secondary priority carrier configured in the system, ensuring uninterrupted order fulfillment. During the order injection process, it is crucial to establish a precise mapping between the service levels captured in ECom and those configured in NewStore. If this mapping is not accurately defined, order injection may fail or result in orders being placed on hold due to shipment errors. Therefore, ensuring a correct mapping of service levels is essential to guarantee seamless order fulfillment and prevent potential disruptions.
Important
For step-by-step instructions on configuring service levels, please refer to our tutorial, which can be accessed
here
. Additionally, each service level can be configured with its own unique buyer’s remorse period. This allows for greater flexibility and customization in managing orders and shipments, as different service levels may require varying timeframes for cancellations or modifications.
Please use the
Add or update fulfillment configuration
API to update the routing configuration. The API endpoint includes “
donotuse
” in the URL, please ignore that, it’s safe to proceed with it.
You can find the sample payload for the fulfillment configuration below.

Routing Config
Routing config determines how the platform looks at the order to fulfill. Normally, retailers prefer to keep the DC as the priority location for all the locations.
Important
A tutorial for the routing can be found in
Tutorial: Setting up a fulfillment configuration
. Ignore the “legacy” callout as the new routing API is still being worked upon.
Reach out to the NewStore Point of contact to have the Routing UI in Omnichannel Manager (NOM) enabled.
As a prerequisite to enable the UI, we need to have the Store Capacity defined.
