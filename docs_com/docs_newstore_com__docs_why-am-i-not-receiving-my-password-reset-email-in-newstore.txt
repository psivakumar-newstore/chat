If you’re having trouble receiving the password reset email from NewStore, it can be due to a few different factors. Whether this is your first time logging in, or you’ve used NewStore before, we’ll walk you through the steps to resolve this.
Common Reasons You’re Not Receiving the Password Reset Email:
If You’ve
Never
Logged Into NOM or the Associate App Before:
Check Your Spam or Junk Folder
The reset email might be hiding in your spam or junk folder, so check there first.
Is Your Email Address Correct?
Confirm with your Store Manager that your account was created with the correct, valid email address.
Was Your Email Set Up After Your NewStore Account?
If your NewStore user account was created
before
your
Company
email address was set up, it may have been flagged as
invalid
.
Verify with your IT department that your email is now active.
Contact NewStore Support to
unblock your email address
.
After your email is unblocked, try resetting your password again.
Are You Using a Distribution List or Group Email?
If you’re using a distribution list or group email, check that the list can receive external emails. You may need to adjust its settings.
If You’ve Logged Into NOM or the Associate App Before:
Check Your Spam or Junk Folder
Just like new users, the email could be in your spam/junk folder.
Ensure Your Account Is Active
Ask your Store Manager to verify that your account hasn’t been disabled in NOM. If it is disabled, you won’t be able to receive the reset email.
Still Not Receiving the Email?
If nothing works, reach out to NewStore Support for help.
Additional Scenarios:
If You Receive This Error Message After Requesting a Password Reset:
"Your password reset link has expired."
This error occurs if two password reset emails were sent, and you clicked on the first one, which expired after the second was sent. Here's what to do:
Request another password reset
and ensure you only use the link from the most recent email.
If You Are Set Up as an API User:
If you're setting up an API User and not receiving the password reset email, the problem is likely due to the format of the API user you created. Here’s what you need to do:
Ensure the API user follows the correct format
for your tenant. If it doesn’t match, you won’t receive the reset email.
Solution:
Create a new API user that follows the correct format.
If you accidentally created a NewStore user for API purposes, you'll need to create a new user that adheres to the proper naming conventions.
After following these steps, the password reset should work as expected.
How to Reset Your Password:
In NOM
You can reset any user’s password by going to the login screen and selecting the
"Reset Password"
button.
In the Associate App
Choose the
"Login with Username and Password"
option, which will direct you to the same reset password page.
By following these steps, you should be able to troubleshoot the issue and successfully receive your password reset email. If you're still having issues, don't hesitate to reach out to NewStore Support for additional assistance.
