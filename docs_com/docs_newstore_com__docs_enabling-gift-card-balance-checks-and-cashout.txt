When enabled for your business, associates can scan a gift card to:
Check the available balance on the gift card
Provide a cashout against the gift card to the customer
Pre-requisities
To enable this feature, you must have these features enabled for your business:
Cash management at NewStore
An active integration with a gift card provider
Enabling gift card cashout and balance checks
To enable gift card cashouts and balance checks against gift cards for customers:
Use the
Update gift card configuration
method.
Set the
store_configurations
>
cash_out_enabled
property to
true
.
Once the feature has been enabled, you can use the
List transaction types
method to retrieve and verify that
non-sale
cash management events are available as transactions via the Event Stream. The transaction type (in the
transaction_types
property) for such gift card cashout events are specified with the value as
gift_card_cash_out
.
Associate App uses the
Gift Card API
to activate, deactivate, or check the available balance on a gift card.
Note
For some integrations with gift card providers, the
Deactivate Gift Card
method may not be supported. In these cases, it may be necessary to map the
Deactivate Gift Card
method to a
Redeem Gift Card
or similar API call to complete the gift card cashout process.
See
Cashing out a gift card
to understand how this feature can be used via Associate App. The gift card cashout transactions are also available via Omnichannel Manager reports, see
Monitoring cash transactions
.
