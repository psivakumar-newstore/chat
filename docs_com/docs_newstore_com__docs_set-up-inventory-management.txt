NewStore Omnichannel Cloud allows you to manage inventory operations and stock locations using Associate App. You can enable a store in your business to use NewStore as inventory master, instead of an ERP, to manage inventory-related operations and data.
If you use NewStore as an inventory master for a store, these inventory operations rely on stock locations that help you manage salable and unsalable stock.
To manage inventory-related operations and data, you can use an ERP or NewStore as inventory master.

Overview of the inventory setup
Setting up inventory in the NewStore platform involves the following tasks:
Receiving inventory
To receive inventory, the feature must first be configured and made available to associates. Once set up, associates can efficiently receive, verify, and organize incoming products directly within the Associate App. This capability ensures that inventory is updated in real-time, reducing manual errors and accurately reflecting stock availability both in-store and across the omnichannel ecosystem. To receive inventory in your store using Associate App, see

.
Transferring inventory
The inventory transfer feature enables associates to move stock between different locations within the retail network. This task helps maintain optimal inventory levels across stores, ensuring products are available where they are most needed. To transfer inventory using Associate App, see

.
Cycle count inventory
Cycle counting allows stores to regularly check and verify their inventory levels without the need for a full physical inventory count. This task helps maintain inventory accuracy, detect discrepancies, and ensure that stock levels are up-to-date. To count inventory in your store using Associate App, see

.
Full count inventory
Full counting allows Retail Operations to schedule periodic inventory counts for financial reporting and overall product review. The store is divided into temporary zones for counting, with any discrepancies reviewed before final submission. This process updates both the on-hand quantities and third-party systems, such as the ERP.
Adjusting inventory
Inventory adjustments are necessary for managing discrepancies, damages, or other changes in stock levels. Associates can use the Associate App to make these adjustments, ensuring that inventory records remain accurate and reflective of actual stock on hand. To adjust inventory in your store using Associate App, see
