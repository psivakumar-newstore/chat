To configure and activate
NewStore Checkout
, you have to work jointly with NewStore and Adyen.
Important
Before proceeding, ensure that you have set up the
Core Adyen integration
prior to configuring NewStore Checkout, and build this integration as an additional measure.
NewStore Checkout uses the merchant accounts and store mapping from
Additional settings to process payments with Adyen terminals
.
When these integrations are ready, start setting up the NewStore Checkout configuration.
Overview
The NewStore platform leverages NewStore Checkout to allow customers to pay for in-store transactions or for items bought via remote selling or clienteling transactions. NewStore Checkout enables retailers to accept payments via an integration with the Adyen's
Pay By Link
feature. Customers can use their phones or digital devices to pay for orders instead of relying on the store's payment device. Associate App displays a QR code that customers can scan to begin the payment process.
Retailers must also have NewStore Checkout configured to enable payment during remote selling or clienteling operations. Customers who buy items via remote selling or clienteling transactions are redirected to a payment page URL on their device (digital, laptop, or PC) where they can complete the payment process.
When using NewStore Checkout, note that these payment transactions are handled within the Adyen system as
CARD-NOT-PRESENT
transactions and follow an eCommerce flow within Adyen, and are. stored within the Adyen customer area as
eCommerce transactions
. However, they are also displayed in the
Merchants POS
account section and are attributed to the specific store location from where the transaction has originated.
Remote payment links introduce a certain level of risk around payment fraud, similar to eCommerce transactions. For remote selling and clienteling transactions, the customer is not physically present with the associate, which means there is a higher risk for payment fraud. NewStore recommends that you work with your Adyen account manager to properly set up and configure
Adyen Pay by Link
and
Risk
settings within the
Customer Area
, and use risk management tools such as such as AVS (address verification service) and other fraud checks.
Important
NewStore recommends that you enable these options in Adyen when using NewStore Checkout with
Adyen Pay By Link
:
AVS (Address Verification System)
- This requires the customer to enter the billing address associated with the credit card being used for payment, if
Credit Card
is enabled as a payment method.
NewStore does not mandate associates to capture billing address information from customers in Associate App. The app only needs a shipping address to ship an item. NewStore sends the shipping address for each transaction to Adyen, which can then be used for AVS verification if this is enabled.
Name on Card
- This requires the customer to enter the name as it appears on the credit card when
Credit Card
is selected as a payment method.
Note
Discuss additional fraud and risk settings for Adyen Pay by Link with Adyen directly.
Getting Started
NewStore Checkout enables store associates to offer customers an innovative payment method where the customer can pay via their phone with wallets generally available for e-commerce. This includes Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal and Direct card.
To configure NewStore Checkout you have to work jointly with NewStore and Adyen. It is important that the configuration on NewStore and Adyen side are aligned to avoid payment errors.
Contact Adyen support to ensure that the POS merchant account can accept both of the following shopper interactions:
e-commerce
POS

Dear Adyen Support:

This support request relates to a NewStore Checkout integration. With this type of
integration a POS account is used to perform eCommerce transactions using the Adyen Pay
By Link capabilities and the Adyen Checkout API.

Our POS Merchant Account needs to be configured to accept eCommerce processing.

Each payment method that is configured needs to be activated as eCom and it should be
generically available for all stores of the account.

Integrator: NewStore

Feature: NewStore Checkout and Adyen Pay By Link

MerchantAccount: <INSERT THE MERCHANT ACCOUNT HERE>

<for troubleshooting requests you can also include payloads>
Within the
Adyen Customer Area
, ensure your Adyen web service user has the
Merchant Recurring role
and the
Checkout webservice role
settings activated so that NewStore Checkout can also perform transactions using the same merchant account.
Important
Both roles are required in order to activate NewStore Checkout.
Note
To set up the corresponding credentials, see
Configuring the Adyen API credentials
.
Ensure that the default capture delay (in addition to the POS capture delay) for this merchant account is set consistently with your Adyen integration.
Send the web service user credentials to your contact point at NewStore and request NewStore Checkout activation.
Important
Copy the full web service username, it should look like
ws_<12345>@Company.newstore
. See
Configuring NewStore Checkout in the platform
.

method.
Specify the following values for the
checkout_api
property:
Feature/Property
Configuration setting
base_url
the Adyen payment processing API base URL. In a
test
environment this URL should be set to
https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v53
. In a
live
environment a unique URL is provided to every retailer. The live URL will have the following structure:
<https://{random}-{company name}-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout/v53>
<https://8abc203-retailer-checkout-live.adyenpayments.com/checkout/v53>

environment
Determines if the payment processing is happening in a production or test environment.
Apply the updated configuration using the
Update PSP Adyen configuration
method.
Complete the NewStore configuration by adding the
NewStore Checkout
payment option to store configurations.
Use
Update payment options configuration
method.
Add
adyen_pay_by_link
in
payment_options
for each of the stores that will use NewStore Checkout.
While you can also add NewStore Checkout on a global level, setting this up at a store level allows for better control and fraud prevention in your stores. Stores that do not have
adyen_pay_by_link
set in
payment_options
will not be able to use NewStore Checkout.
NewStore Checkout is now enabled.
Completing the NewStore Checkout configuration in Adyen
After you have set up and configured NewStore Checkout in the platform, access the
Adyen Customer Area
and navigate to the
Adyen Pay by Link
section within the
Merchant account
that will use NewStore Checkout with Adyen Pay by Link.
Note
This section describes setting up NewStore Checkout options in Adyen. For detailed steps or more information on this process, see the official
Adyen documentation for Pay By Link
.
Select
Themes
and create a custom theme for the Adyen Pay By Link payment page. You can specify a display name, a company logo, a background image, and the background color for the payment page that will be sent to the customer during the payment process.
Save this as the default theme, which will then be used for all Newstore Checkout transactions in Associate App.
Go to
Settings
in your Adyen account and complete the following configuration steps:
Legal
: Specify the URL for the T&Cs that govern Shopper acceptance for using Adyen Pay by Link. The Merchant account MUST mandatorily provide this to use Adyen Pay By Link.
eMail
- Enter the email address for the merchant account where notifications will be sent when a Adyen Pay by Link payment link is created manually.
Credit card settings
:
Name on Card
- Ensure that you enable this option if you will use Adyen Fraud and Risk management tools. This ensures that the cardholder's name is sent to Adyen for all Pay By link purchases. NewStore recommends that you enable this setting for ALL use cases to ensure fraud prevention.
AVS (Address Verification Service)
- Ensure that you enable this option if you will use Adyen Fraud and Risk management tools. This ensures that the customer provides their billing address when performing a Pay by Link purchase. NewStore recommends that you enable this setting for ALL use cases to ensure fraud prevention.

Configure Payment Methods in Adyen Customer Area:
NewStore Checkout can support multiple payment methods that are available within Adyen. When using NewStore Checkout with Adyen Pay by Link, additional payment methods may be made available on the payment pages.  When configuring payment methods within Adyen, Merchants should consult with their Adyen account rep to understand how payment methods are displayed within the payment page based on where the payment methods are defined (at the store level or the merchant level).
Note
NewStore merchants who are using earlier versions of NewStore Checkout (via the web-drop in) and want to migrate to Pay by Link
must open a support ticket with Adyen
to delete the Apple Pay payment method for the Merchant Account that is intended to use the updated version of NewStore Checkout.
Add Apple Pay as a payment method again with the updated configuration
after
the existing Apple Pay configurations have been deleted from the Merchant account.
Any payment methods defined at the store level will
ALWAYS
be available via the NewStore Checkout and Adyen Pay by Link payment pages. For example, even if a retailer does not want to offer credit cards as a payment option via NewStore Checkout, specific credit card payment methods will still be available to customers in the app if they have already been assigned to a specific store.
For
production
environments, in the Adyen Customer area, go to
Settings
>
Payment Methods
:
Add Apple Pay as a payment method for each store where NewStore Checkout will be supported. Enter the FQDN as
https://eu.adyen.link
within the prompt.
This defaults as the FQDN for all Pay By Link pages for Apple Pay.
Add Google Pay as a payment method. Enter the FQDN as
https://eu.adyen.link
to your Google Payments Console configuration.
Add PayPal as a payment method for each store where NewStore Checkout will be supported. When prompted, specify the required information to complete the PayPal configuration.
For
staging
environments, in the Adyen Customer area, go to
Settings
>
Payment Methods
:
Add Apple Pay as a payment method for each store where NewStore Checkout will be supported. Enter the FQDN as
https://TEST.adyen.link
within the prompt.
This defaults as the FQDN for all Pay By Link pages for Apple Pay.
Add Google Pay as a payment method. Enter the FQDN as
https://TEST.adyen.link
to your Google Payments Console configuration.
Add PayPal as a payment method for each store where NewStore Checkout will be supported. When prompted, specify the required information to complete the PayPal configuration.
Important
NewStore and Adyen recommend
NOT
to use alternative payment methods that allow payments in installments. These methods can introduce significant delays in receiving payment confirmation and processing payment requests, causing them to fail.
In the Adyen Customer Area, go to
Settings
>
Checkout Settings
:
Select each country where there is a physical store that will offer NewStore Checkout and Adyen Pay by Link.
Select the appropriate payment and checkout configuration options to be displayed to customers. When using NewStore Checkout as an in-store payment method for remote selling opportunities (where a payment link is sent to shoppers remotely, either via text message or email), the Adyen Pay by Link payment pages use the
Store Country Code
to control which payment methods are displayed to customers on the payment page.
ALL RETAILERS USING NEWSTORE CLIENTELING
will display
all available payment methods
configured for the Merchant Account for the store within Adyen.
When sharing a remote cart via clienteling messages, customers in your business will see and be able to select any payment methods that are available within the Adyen merchant account configuration. This may actually be more than what is displayed if you are using the
Country Code
to control visibility of payment methods.
Note
Any payment methods defined at the store level are
ALWAYS
displayed to the customer, even if the payment method has been moved to the
Other Configured Payment Options
section.
To learn how to use the payment methods in Associate App, see
Choosing a payment option
.
