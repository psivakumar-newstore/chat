Logging in
There are 2 ways to log into the app:
Using your credentials
Using your PIN
Using your credentials

If your business has enabled logging into NewStore Associate App with your existing corporate credentials, use them to log into the app. Otherwise, use your assigned NewStore credentials.
Technical configuration
The following section involves working with technical configurations and APIs. Contact your IT support team for more information.
To set up credentials, see
Configuring identity and access management
.
To log in using your credentials:
Ensure that you know your login and password.
On the login screen, to log in for the first time, use one of the following options:
Your NewStore credentials - Tap
Login with Username and Password
.
Your existing corporate credentials - Tap

Not your store?
and tap
Log out

If enabled for your business, you will be automatically assigned to the store to which the device is assigned via the MDM, even if you are assigned to a different store in Omnichannel Manager.
This feature ensures that you do not have to ask management or support to reassign you in Omnichannel Manager every time you switch stores.
