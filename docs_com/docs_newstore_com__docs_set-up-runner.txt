Runners help you move products from the stockroom to the sales floor, to a sales associate who is serving a shopper or to refill the sales floor.
You can benefit from using the Runner when you display multiple units of SKUs of a specific product style on the sales floor, and shoppers can pick the products and purchase without assistance. You can then use the Runner to submit Replenishment requests to replenish the purchased products on the sales floor.
On the other hand, if you display only 1 SKU of a specific product style on the sales floor, then you can use the Runner to submit Try On requests, as an associate will need to help the shopper enable the purchase.
Runners in a retail store are responsible for delivering products to the sales floor fast, ensuring a smooth shopping experience for customers and an increase in conversion.
