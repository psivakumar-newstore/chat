Prerequisites
Complete the module's
Module 1 - Foundational Setup
before you proceed.
The NewStore
Product Details Page (PDP)
offers flexibility in displaying and managing product information, enabling retailers to tailor the page to their specific business needs. These customizations enhance the ability of associates to access critical product information beyond the standard PDP view, facilitating better customer interactions.
Customizing additional product details
Retailers can configure the PDP to display additional product information that is not available out of the box. This customization is managed through the
Associate App configuration
by adding the necessary extended attribute keys and labels.
Loading additional data
To display additional data, ensure the extended attributes are loaded during the product data import. The attribute keys and corresponding labels should then be configured in the Associate App settings under:
Configuring the app for display
In the Associate App configuration, configure the list of the extended attributes. Additionally, the configuration allows for locale-based customization, enabling you to tailor settings for different regions. If an attribute is absent for a particular product, the app will hide the label and value on the PDP
.

Note
Refer the
Associate app configuration
to configure the
displayed_extended_attributes
property.
Utilizing webviews for product details
The PDP also supports webview integrations, offering dynamic access to external systems and data. Webviews can be used for:
Product recommendations
: Show personalized suggestions based on customer preferences.
Service management
: Add additional product-related services like repairs, alterations, or cleaning while adding the item to the cart.
Extended product information
: Include more detailed product descriptions, specifications, or imagery while adding the item to the cart.
Webview configurations are accessible under the Product Details Page in the Associate App customizations. Admin users can set up webviews to display tailored information directly on the PDP.
Typical use case for PDP webviews
Personalized recommendations
for cross-selling or upselling
Adding additional details such as repair or alteration options
Displaying gift registry information or related product offers
For more information on configuring webviews, refer to the
Associate App configuration guide
.
By leveraging these PDP customizations, associates can access comprehensive product details, improving their ability to assist customers and provide personalized service.
