You can use external identifiers such as a serial number in NewStore Associate App to track products through the order lifecycle, such as during in-store purchase or order fulfillment in NewStore.
If enabled for your business, associates can use NewStore Associate App to scan the serial number of a product during checkout as well as at the
picking
stage during order fulfillment.
Important
NewStore Associate App allows associates to add a serial number to products that are
only
available for in-store purchase. If the item is to be shipped to the customer, NewStore Associate App does not prompt the associate to add a serial number during checkout.
For more information on how serial numbers are added during checkout in NewStore Associate App, see
Adding an in-store item
.
Configuring serial numbers support
To configure for serial numbers in the NewStore platform, specify that products in your business have serial numbers when
importing product data
into the platform.
In the
import payload
, set
serialized_inventory
to
true
for the products that you want to import and that will have a serial number on each item. For more information on importing data, see the
Importing data
or the
tutorial
.
Adding serial numbers in NewStore Associate App
If products in your business have serial numbers, you also have to ensure that NewStore Associate App is enabled to scan these serial numbers and add them to the products during checkout in the app.
Note
Setting up serial numbers in NewStore Associate App is
optional
. If this configuration is not set up, NewStore Associate App does not validate serial numbers while scanning products or when an associate adds them manually in the app.
To enable this configuration:
Use the
Update app configuration
method.
In
capabilities
>
serialized_inventory
>
serial_number_regex
, specify the type and format of serial numbers that can be scanned by the app.
For example, you can specify that serial numbers in your business will be a string of
14
numerical characters, such as
^[A-Z0-9]{14}$
.
Validate that NewStore Associate App can scan product serial numbers correctly by scanning a sample serial number from available inventory in the store.
Important
NewStore Associate App
cannot
identify an item by scanning only the serial number. Scan the SKU or barcode before you add the serial number for the item during checkout.
Serial numbers are not tracked once the products have been routed for fulfillment or shipped.
