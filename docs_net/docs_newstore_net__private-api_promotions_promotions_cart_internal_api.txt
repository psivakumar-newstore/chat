Use this method to apply existing promotions to a cart to view how pricing during checkout will be calculated based on these promotions. As a default the NewStore promotion engine is used, otherwise a third party promotion engine will be used if properly configured (see NewStore documentation about third party promotion engine).
When using the NewStore promotions engine, this method is idempotent, and does not change the state of the cart or products added to the cart. When using a third party promotion engine the idempotency depends on the integration and third party promotion engine.
This method returns a version of the cart (
DiscountedCart
) with all specified promotions applied to it. The order of the discounts in the array of discounts attached to each item in a
DiscountedCart
is important and should not be changed when being used in other services or contexts.
