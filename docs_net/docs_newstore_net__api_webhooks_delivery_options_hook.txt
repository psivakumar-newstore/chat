Represents the checkout step during which shipping options are required.
This resource contains the provider rate of an order.
A provider rate is how NewStore identifies a shipping provider and the rates they offer.
For example,
FedEx Overnight
,
UPS Next Day
,
DHL On-demand delivery
.
Note:
If youâ€™re looking to
integrate a shipping provider
for booking, updating, and canceling deliveries, see
Shipping Provider Webhooks
.
A typical use case for the shipping options webhook is to define the supported shipping providers and rates for a
specific list of products being purchased. If an ordered product is too heavy or too large, for example, these
webhooks allow you to offer a customer
customized shipping prices
that can cater to this non-standard package.
To develop an adapter, see
shipping options
.

Get customized provider rates for an order
Requests provider rates configuration, including service level, provider name, and shipping offer price.
Any provider rate response here OVERRIDES any other provider rate configuration made in NewStore.
This means you fully control which values are in use. If something is not available, consider it empty.
For example,
return_provider_rate
is not supported through custom provider rates.
The order of the returned rates is important
: it will override any priority or existing order that you can
have in your
fulfillment configuration
.
Important:
See
Retrieving custom shipping prices
to understand how to use the
use_as_customer_facing_cost
flag in the
fulfillment configuration and the price
source
in your adapter.
