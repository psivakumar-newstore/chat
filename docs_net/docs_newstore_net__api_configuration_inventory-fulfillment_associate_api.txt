Update shipping status
Marks some or all items in a fulfillment request assigned to a store as shipped.
When an order cannot be fulfilled in a store because of external reasons such as the failure of a shipment provider API,
the retailer usually ships the items manually. However, this data is not processed in NewStore, which leads to order
data that is not in sync for the retailer.
Use this endpoint to manually mark such shipments that have been done outside of NewStore as shipped, and keep the order
and routing data in sync with the real world.
Important
: Using this method overrides system workflow rules and the actual status of the shipment, and marks the
specified items as shipped.
To update the shipping status of orders that are fulfilled by a
DC
, use
this method
instead.
