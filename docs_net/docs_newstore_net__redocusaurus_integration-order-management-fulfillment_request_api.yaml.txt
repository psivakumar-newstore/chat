  description: >
    The API provides access to the fulfillment request. This API allows you to
    get information

    about fulfillment requests and perform operations on them.


    **Note:** Fulfillment requests are immutable. It means that rerouting will
    create a new

    fulfillment request even if all items in the fulfillment request stay the
    same.

        Returns all fulfillment requests created for an order, sorted by
        creation date in the

        ascending order (earliest first).


        If order wasn't found, then the empty list of fulfillment requests will
        be returned.


        If order wasn't routed yet, then the empty list of fulfillment requests
        will be returned.


        **Important:** As for now this API will return fulfillment requests even
        for orders without

        routing (like in_store_purchase) but this behavior will change soon. And
        this API will only

        work for orders where routing is needed. So, build your integrations
        accordingly.


        **Important:** Maximum number of fulfillment requests this API will
        return is **2000**. If

        there are more than **2000** fulfillment requests for the order, then
        the response will have

        400 status code (although it is actually not a bad request) and **2000**
        latest (according

        to the creaiton date) fulfillment requests.

      description: >
        Update the shipment status for items in the specified fulfillment
        request.


        **Important:** Do not confuse this API with

        [Fulfillment Provider
        API](/newstore-cloud/order_management/dc_fulfillment_node_api.html).
        For 

        DC orders please use the Fulfillment Provider API.


        Items in a fulfillment request can be marked as shipped or rejected.
        When you use this API you can't mix

        shipment and rejection actions on the same call.


        **Important:** If you are doing a partial rejection of items in a
        fulfillment request, the reroute

        attempt will not happen until all items in the fulfillment request are
        in a terminal state.


        For fulfillment requests which are routed to store fulfillment nodes,
        the item state update

        will only be accepted if the request has not been picked by a store
        associate. The change in

        status is only valid for items that are not in a final state (the
        fulfillment process for the

        item is considered as complete). The remaining items are not

        affected by this change.


        **Important**: When you reject items that are currently fulfilled in DC
        we don't notify DC about items rejection. 

        You are responsible for communicating with DC API to ensure these items
        will not be shipped.


        **Rejection reason**:


        To reject a fulfillment request you must provide the rejection reason
        "rescinded". This will initiate

        a re-routing attempt without any changes to inventory levels.


        **Edge Cases:**

        - If your organization's settings allows rerouting by setting
        `reroute_to_rejected_fulfillment_nodes` (

        described in this 

        [API](https://docs.newstore.net/api/configuration/inventory-fulfillment/logistic_order_config#operation/set-reroute-to-rejected-fulfillment-nodes))

        to `true`, rejected fulfillment nodes will be downgraded in priority
        during the routing process. If all possible

        nodes for a given `location_group` in [routing
        configuration](https://docs.newstore.net/api/integration/delivery/routing_ruleset_api#operation/get-routing-rules)

        are exhausted, it will take the first available fulfillment node as part
        of the mechanism, resulting in a

        potential route to the same location on further attempts.

        - Setting `reroute_to_rejected_fulfillment_nodes` to `false`,
        fulfillment nodes will be ignored during future

        routing attempts. If all fulfillment nodes are rejected and you don't
        want to reroute to these nodes, the

        rejected items will be put on hold.


        **Important**: The platform emits a separate event for each line item
        that is marked as

        shipped, and not a single event for all items. This should be considered
        when reconciling these

        events in the ERP you are using to manage such events.
