Manage deliveries or shipments in the NewStore platform using these webhooks.
To learn how NewStore integrates with a shipping provider, see the
guide
.
Shipments
Represents the shipment(s) created once an order with delivery is being placed.
Depending on the provider, a shipment is generally pre-booked (also called a delivery promise),
then booked, and finally tracked.
As an integrator, implement the methods of this resource to integrate a shipping provider
such as UPS with NewStore Cloud.
The integration of a shipment provider also uses the
Shipping offers
resource. For more
information about the integration, see
Integrating a shipping provider
.
Note:
The validity of a shipping offer token can vary based on the shipping provider and
shipping offer. For
in-store pickup
orders, a shipping offer token does not expire.
Book shipment
