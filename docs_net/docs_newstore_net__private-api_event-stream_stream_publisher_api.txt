Register new integration
Registers a new integration. You can specify how the events will be sent to you:
via the
webhook
. The events are provided in real time.
via file upload to the S3 bucket of your choice. An upload typically occurs every 5 minutes.
By default, you will receive all the events that NewStore can provide.
To only receive specific events, use the
filter_conditions
property
to set filters on entities and/or events. To see all entities and
events, see the
entity model
.
When you call this method, the integration starts automatically, you do not need to call the
Start
integration
method. At most 10 integrations can be registered.
You can also use this method to replay events by date. To do this, set a start and end date
when you call this method. The use of an end date registers a
temporary
integration that will receive
all events that were emitted between the start and end date. When the last event of the end date is emitted,
the integration is automatically stopped.
In case of webhook integration, if you use the
api_key
property then every call to the URL set in the
callback_url
property includes the line
Authorization: Bearer <api_key>
in its header.
In case of S3 integration, the events are stored in multiple files with the following name:
s3://{bucket}/{key_prefix}/{tenant}/{timestamp}-data-{random_string}.export
, where:
bucket
and
key_prefix
are the parameters you specified in
s3_parameters
.
timestamp
is the time, when the file was created on the server, in epoch millis.
Every file contains multiple JSON objects, one per event, delimited by a newline character.
The events are described with the same schema as in the
webhook
.
A new file is started every 5 minutes, or when the size of the current file reaches 50 MiB, whichever happens first.
Note:
The start and end date as well as integration type can not be modified after creation.
