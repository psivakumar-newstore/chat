Represents a refund request, triggered by a return. It can be applied to all or specific
items of an order. If needed, shipping costs can be refunded as well.
A refund request can be pending, successful, or failed. A successful refund request may depend
on the captured amount and on previous refunds (pending and successful).

Create item level refund request
Creates a refund request to initiate a refund for a set of given order line items. This call is asynchronous.
A successful response means that the refund request was accepted and will be executed after there are enough
captured funds.
In case an order-level refund already exists, this API will process all refunds on order-level to provide
backwards compatibility.
Note:
When the refund request is successful, an email is sent to the customer if you provided their email
address. No email is sent for historical refund requests.
Note:
This API currently supports refund requests with monetary values.
