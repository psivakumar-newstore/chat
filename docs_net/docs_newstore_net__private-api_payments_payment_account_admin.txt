Payments Administration
This association is done by assigning the same ID to the payment account and the entity it is linked to.
Payments
Represents a payment account used during order placement.
  It has a balance and stores the transactions and the financial instruments that modified its balance.
Use this resource to retrieve information about a payment account.
  A payment account can also be used to track the balance and transactions of other entities
  created by the NewStore platform. For example, a payment account can be associated with an entity such as a sales order, a customer,
  or a shopping bag by assigning the same ID to the payment account and to the entity.
Note
- Currently, NewStore only supports assigning the same ID to a payment account and the related sales order.
Retry operation
Retries the financial operation (authorization, capture or refund) identified by the provided correlation identifier.
To get an operation's correlation identifier,
use the
Get payment history method
.
