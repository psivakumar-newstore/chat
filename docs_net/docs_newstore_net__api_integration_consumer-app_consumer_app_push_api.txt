General
All requests must be made over https. The base url is
https://push.highstreetapp-services.com/
Your merchant id will be provided to you by Highstreet. NOTE that the merchant ID is unique per environment
Authentication
All requests are protected by basic auth. You will be supplied with a user name and password by
Highstreet. If needed you can request this by contacting
support@highstreetmobile.com
Testing
When testing it's important to not send requests to the production environment as this can result in notifications being sent to real users. Your production merchant id will look something like
brand
whereas the merchant ID of the staging environment will look something like
brand-staging
. Also it's important to realise that if an email address is not specified in the request that a request will be sent out to all users that match the specified locale(s).
Localisation
Locales are identified using language tags as defined by
IETF BCP 47
. Countries are identified by two character
country codes as defined by
ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2
. A locale can also be
referred to as a storefront. An example of a valid locale is
nl-NL
.
Dates and Time
Dates and times follow the
ISO 8601 standard
.
Notification
Personalized notifications can be sent to individual customers.
Customers are identified by their e-mail address.
Notifications can be cancelled if they have not already been sent.
The notification endpoints are provided by Highstreet.
Authentication
HTTP Basic Authentication is used for authentication. The credentials will be provided by
Highstreet.
Images
A notification
may
have two attached images:
A thumbnail image; shown on the lock screen (pictured below left). The minimum image size for
the thumbnail is 160x160 pixels with an aspect ratio of 1:1.
A larger image shown when the details of the notification are opened (pictured below right).
The minimum image size for the bigger image is 1120x680 pixels with an aspect ratio of 16:9.
On IOS a user can view the larger image by pressing or swiping left on the notification.
Deeplinks
A Notification will link to a specified location within the app. The current valid locations are
vouchers
,
cart
,
products
,
categories
,
lookbooks
,
content_extension
,
orders
and
home
. A valid id of the linked
resource also needs to be supplied unless specifying
home
,
vouchers
or
cart
.
Send a notification
Sends a push notification to a specific customer. The customer is identified by their email
address.
The customer's preferred locale is unknown to the loyalty platform. All locales have to
be specified.
A List of IDs are returned. These represent the scheduled or sent notifications. These
should be stored as they are needed to cancel a scheduled notification.
Note:
Most of the
time only one notification will be sent. However there are some circumstances where the
same user may have the app installed on multiple devices each in a different locale.
Resulting in a separate notification being created for each locale.
