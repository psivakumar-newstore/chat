            The event publishing request from NewStore was successfully accepted
            by your system.


            **Important:** If you respond with anything other than a 200
            response code, the whole event stream is

            interrupted and NewStore will keep sending you the last event you
            didn't acknowledge with a 200

            response code. When you reach the retry limit, no events are sent.

        **Managing duplicate events:**

        You can receive data from Newstore via Event stream webhooks, as
        Newstore supports emitting data at least once to

        your integration point. However, Event stream webhooks sometimes deliver
        events more than once. To protect

        your integration point from duplicate events, we advise you to make your
        event processing

        [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence). You can detect
        duplicate events by comparing your

        event's idempotency key with the idempotency keys of previous events.
        For each event, you will see an

        idempotency key in your webhook description. For more information,

        see [Stripe's blog](https://stripe.com/en-de/blog/idempotency) on
        idempotency or the

        NewStore
        [guide](/developers/guides/eventstream#managing-duplicate-events).


        > **_NOTE:_** Currently the idempotency key is only unique *per event*.
        Add the event name to the idempotency key to get a

        unique key across all events.


        **Order of events:**

        You will not receive events in a specific order. You may receive an
        `order.cancelled` event before the

        corresponding `order.created` event.


        **Event delivery:**

        We take at most 15 minutes to send an event to your integration endpoint
        according to the service-level agreement (SLA) between a retailer

        and NewStore. However, usually, it takes seconds to complete this
        operation.


        **Response code:**

        The response code you send back decides whether the whole stream should
        be interrupted or

        maintained. See the **Responses** section below for more information.


        **Deprecation note:**

        The `order.shipped` event has been deprecated. Use the `order.completed`
        event

        for data related to orders that are closed in the NewStore platform.

                  Omnichannel Cloud.


                  If the payment authorization fails, this event is not emitted
                  but you might be able to see

                  this order in NewStore Omnichannel Manager, depending on your
                  configuration.


                  This event is sent at the beginning of the grace period.
