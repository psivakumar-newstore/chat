      Represents the shipment(s) created once an order with delivery is being
      placed.

      Depending on the provider, a shipment is generally pre-booked (also called
      a delivery promise),

      then booked, and finally tracked.


      As an integrator, implement the methods of this resource to integrate a
      shipping provider

      such as UPS with NewStore Cloud.


      The integration of a shipment provider also uses the [Shipping
      offers](#tag/Shipping-offers) resource. For more

      information about the integration, see [Integrating a shipping
      provider](/developers/guides/shipment).


      **Note:** The validity of a shipping offer token can vary based on the
      shipping provider and

      shipping offer. For `in-store pickup` orders, a shipping offer token does
      not expire.

                      only send it back to the adapter when needed. Required for
                      ScanForms and Shipment Cancellation. The value must be a
                      direct reference to the booked shipment. As an example,
                      Easypost uses a shipment id and rate id to identify the
                      booked shipment. The offer value here should then contain
                      such value. For other carriers, please adapt and use an
                      identifier that allows to directly reference the shipment.
                      If the tracking code is all you have, you may use it,
                      however it might not be optimal.
