Create return
Initiates the return process for item(s) in an order.
Imports a historical return into NewStore when
is_historical
is set to true.
NewStore creates condition codes for your business.
To retrieve the list of condition codes configured for your business, contact
the support team.
The refund amount is calculated by the platform, and
cannot
be provided in the payload:
NewStore calculates the refund amount for each returned order line considering any pre-existing appeasements.
If the config property
refund_shipping_cost
is set to
True
and all items in the
order are returned, the amount refunded includes the sum of the item prices and the
shipping costs.
If the config property
refund_shipping_cost
is not set, or set to
False
,
the sum of the item prices is refunded. Shipping costs are not included in this amount,
and not refunded.
If the config property
return_fee
is set, the amount refunded will have the return fee deducted from it.
If the
return_fee
field is set in the return payload, the default tenant configuration
return_fee
is ignored.
If multiple items with same product ID are provided, the item with minimum amount left will be refunded first.
Example:
