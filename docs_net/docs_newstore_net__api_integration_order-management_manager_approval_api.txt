Create approval rule
Creates a rule containing the criteria that determines if an order needs approval before it can be placed
by an associate via NewStore Associate App.
You can use the following criteria to set approval rules:
Criterion name
Type
has_discount
Boolean
discount_value
Number
discount_percentage
Number
discount_level
order
or
item
payment_method
String
is_return
Boolean
is_blind_return
Boolean
refund_value
Number
has_tax_exemption

Available values of the
payment_method
field are:
cash
,
credit_card

manual_credit_card
,
gift_card
, and
non_integrated
.
Note:
NewStore Associate App allows the associate to apply discounts either on
order
level or on
item
level using the
discount_level
property. If no value for
discount_level
is specified, it is set
to
order
by default.
You can apply a fixed discount amount to an order or item(s) using the
discount_value
property.
If an order or item matches or exceeds the criteria specified in the approval rules, the
order will need approval on the app.
