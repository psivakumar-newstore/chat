        Creates a rule containing the criteria that determines if an order needs
        approval before it can be placed

        by an associate via NewStore Associate App.


        You can use the following criteria to set approval rules:


        | Criterion name      | Type              |

        |---------------------|-------------------|

        |`has_discount`       | Boolean           |

        |`discount_value`     | Number            |

        |`discount_percentage`| Number            |

        |`discount_level`     | `order` or `item` |

        |`payment_method`     | String            |

        |`is_return`          | Boolean           |

        |`is_blind_return`    | Boolean           |

        |`refund_value`       | Number            |

        |`has_tax_exemption`  | Boolean           |

        |`order_value`        | Number            |


        Available values of the `payment_method` field are: `cash`,
        `credit_card`, `manual_credit_card`, `gift_card`, and `non_integrated`.


        **Note:** NewStore Associate App allows the associate to apply discounts
        either on `order` level or on

        `item` level using the `discount_level` property. If no value for
        `discount_level` is specified, it is set

        to `order` by default.


        You can apply a fixed discount amount to an order or item(s) using the
        `discount_value` property.


        If an order or item matches or exceeds the criteria specified in the
        approval rules, the

        order will need approval on the app.
