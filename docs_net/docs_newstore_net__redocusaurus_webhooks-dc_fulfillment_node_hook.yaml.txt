    Represents the fulfillment requests that NewStore might send you, to fulfill
    using a

    fulfillment provider (WMS, OMS, 3PL).


    To integrate your fulfillment provider with NewStore, implement the method
    in this resource.

    Also see [Fulfillment
    requests](/newstore-cloud/order_management/dc_fulfillment_node_api.html).
