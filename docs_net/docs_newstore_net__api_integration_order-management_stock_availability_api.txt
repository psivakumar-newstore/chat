Represents the
ATP
of products in a fulfillment location (store or DC).
Use this API to retrieve the ATP for products across your fulfillment locations.
ATP is calculated by subtracting the sum of all allocations, reservations, and safety stock
quantity, from the stock on hand. At NewStore, ATP is also the sum of the current ATP and
future ATP
.
For example, use it to get the ATP of the products in a store, to perform a reconciliation with
your ERP.
