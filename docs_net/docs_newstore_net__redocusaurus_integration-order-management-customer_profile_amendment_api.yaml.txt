    Use this
resource
to manage customer profiles that are
    associated with orders

    in the NewStore platform.


    Using this API, you can create a request to update the customer profile
    information for specified

    orders, and add details such as an updated name or external ID, email, or
    internal customer ID to the order.

    The order details in the NewStore platform are updated in the background,
    with an

    update rate limit of 20,000 orders/hour.


    Once updated, the orders are listed for the associated customer profile in
    NOM or Associate App.


    **Important**:.

    - There is no validation check for the profile details in the platform, and
    no external events
      are emitted. When using this API, ensure that the correct details are being updated
      for the order and associated customer, and that you reconcile these changes in any external
      systems that require these modifications.
    - Ensure that the customer profile exists in the platform before you add the
    details to an
      associated order via this API.
