Represents a discount rule defining a type of discount. For example, shipping is free when
the order value reaches $70.
A discount rule is not an applicable discount, but it is needed to create a coupon definition
leading to a
coupon
. Using the coupon applies the discount. For more information,
see the coupons
guide
.
Create discount rule
Creates a discount rule.
Important:
Ensure that you specify the value of the
amount
property correctly,
according to the specified currency. For example, if the currency is specified as
USD
and the product price (
amount
) has more than 2 decimal places, it is considered as
invalid by the platform.
For more information, see
pricing dependencies on currency
