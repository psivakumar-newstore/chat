The Event Gateway API can be used by NewStore engineering teams to publish their domain events
via Event Stream. The API is internal and can only used by services running in the shared Kubernetes cluster.
Publish a domain event.
Publish a domain event via event stream. Once submitted, the event can immediately be received by Event Stream
consumers.
header
Parameters
team
required
string
Example:
team-inventory
Name of the team who publishes the event.
service
required
string
Example:
inventory-manager
Name of the service which calls this API.
entity-id
required
string
Example:
000816c3-e9b2-440b-8d27-dfaa4cae00ef
Identifier of the event's main entity (for example an order ID).
tenant
required
string
Example:
dodici
The tenant name.
idempotency-key
required
string
Example:
123816c3-e9b2-440b-8d27-dfaa4cae0bbc
The idempotency key for the event.
correlation-ids
required
string
Example:
'{
    "order_id": "000816c3-e9b2-440b-8d27-dfaa4cae00ef", 
    "customer_id": "000816c3-e9b2-440b-8d27-dfaa4cae00ef"
}'
The correlation-ids relevant for this event. This should be the id of the main aggregate the event belongs 
to. If unsure, it is probably an order. Currently two correlation-id types are supported:
order_id
customer_id
You may define as many correlation-ids as make sense to your context and event. Correlation-ids are mainly
used for debugging and observability purposes, to be able to list all events belonging to a certain 
aggregate and to eg trace all events of an order.
The correlation ids need to be passed in form of a json string of type 
'{"<idtype>": "<value>", ...}', see the example below.
Moving forward the header is required. For a grace period the endpoint defaults to '{}' if the header is not 
specified to maintain backward compatibility.
