    Payments

      Represents a payment account used during order placement.
      It has a balance and stores the transactions and the financial instruments that modified its balance.

      Use this resource to retrieve information about a payment account.
      A payment account can also be used to track the balance and transactions of other entities
      created by the NewStore platform. For example, a payment account can be associated with an entity such as a sales order, a customer,
      or a shopping bag by assigning the same ID to the payment account and to the entity.

      **Note** - Currently, NewStore only supports assigning the same ID to a payment account and the related sales order.

        Returns a snapshot of the account at the time of the request.

        The account balance that you retrieve is positive (> 0) whenever
        payments are authorized, but not captured yet.

        For example, when items are still waiting for fulfillment. If the
        account balance is negative, you might have over-captured the order,

        which means that you have captured an amount bigger than the requested
        amount.
