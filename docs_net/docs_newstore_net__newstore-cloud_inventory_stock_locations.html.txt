An API to manipulate the numbers of inventory in StockLocations (a.k.a.
Virtual Locations) by adding StockChanges.
Return configuration
Enables you to include an item returned to your store in a specific stock location, based on whether
the returned item is salable or not.
You can also use this resource to
create a return configuration
.
Stock locations
Represents the types of
stock locations
configured for your business.
Stock locations are virtual or physical locations that hold salable or unsalable stock. NewStore uses stock locations
to manage inventory and calculate stock on hand in your store(s), when NewStore is enabled as
inventory master
for the store.
Important:
Do not confuse this resource with the
Locations
resource. This resource represents only
physical locations
configured in your business, such as a store or DC,
that you operate from.
You can configure each stock location to allow its stock to be included in stock on hand calculations or not.
See
stock locations
. For example, you can set up a
stock location only for damaged goods, and ensure the stock on hand of your store does not include these goods.
Note:
When you
create a location
for your business,  the salable stock location will be created by default, if there is no salable stock location type exists then the
main
stock location type is created for the location by default. The
salable
property for the
main
stock location is always set to
true
.
To create stock locations that are available for all stores in your
business, use the
Create stock location
method.
For a guide on creating stock locations, see
the
tutorial
.
List stock locations
Retrieves a list of stock locations configured for your business.
