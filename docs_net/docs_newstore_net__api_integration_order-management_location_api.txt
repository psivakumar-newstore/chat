This API represents a physical location in NewStore, such as a DC or a store, that you can operate from.
Important:
Do not confuse this resource with the
Stock locations
resource, which represents
virtual or physical stock locations
.
Use this resource to manage inventory or calculate stock on hand in your store, when NewStore
is enabled as
inventory master
for the store.
Locations are created during a
stock import
using the
fulfillment_node_id
property. For a guide on creating locations (such as stores),
see this
tutorial
.
Important:
Location type(DC or Store), location ID, or location store_id can't be updated after location creation. 
So, please ensure that the locations you are creating have the correct data.
Note:
When you create a location for your business, the main
stock location
is created for the location by default.
When working with a store in your business, you can use this resource to enable NewStore as
the inventory master for the store, instead of an ERP. To understand the difference between
an ERP and NewStore as inventory master, see
Choosing your inventory master
.
You can also choose to stop a location from
fulfilling orders
using this resource. See
Disabling locations
.
Note:
Only stores can use NewStore as inventory master, not DCs.
List locations
Retrieves a list of locations configured for your business. The maximum number of locations returned by this method is 2000.

Enable location as inventory master
Enables the specified location as
inventory master
.
When you enable a location as inventory master, NewStore is the inventory master in the store. NewStore manages
all inventory-related operations and data for the store, instead of an ERP. This includes calculating stock on
hand for the store using
stock locations
.
Important
: NewStore does not support reverting to an ERP after you have enabled NewStore
as inventory master in the store. Ensure that you want to use NewStore as inventory master
before you switch from an ERP.

Disable location
Disables a specific location from fulfilling orders.
When a location is disabled:
Orders are not routed to the location for fulfillment.
ATP for products at this location is set to
0
in
NOM
and for
availability exports
.
However, the values calculated for
stock on hand, allocations, reservations, and safety stock quantities for products at
the location stay unchanged.
Important:
The change in ATP for products in the location that was disabled may
take some time to be displayed in NOM and the availability export data.
Note:
Orders routed to the location before it was disabled are fulfilled via
the usual process. Use
NewStore Fulfillment App
to reject these orders if needed.
