Use this API to configure NewStore as a secondary
order management system
for retailers, to
allow them to continue using their
legacy order management system (OMS) for primary order fulfillment tasks.
When NewStore is the secondary OMS for your business, it provides the
following features from the perspective of order routing and fulfillment:
Order placement and returns via NewStore Associate App. Orders placed via the app
are then routed to the external OMS for fulfillment.
Managing payments for
in-store purchase
orders.
Store fulfillment
and handling shipping
for orders fulfilled via stores.
Inventory management of stores, as NewStore will be the
inventory master
for your business in the stores.
The external or legacy OMS is responsible for the following in your business:
ATP
,
order routing
,
order modifications, and customer support.
Rerouting
rejected store fulfillment orders.
Handling shipping for orders fulfilled from a
DC or warehouse
.
Managing payments for all order fulfillment scenarios except in-store purchases.
