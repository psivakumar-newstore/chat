  title: Shipment notification configuration API
  description: >
    Use these APIs to manage notification options for your shipment related
    events.


    **Note**: NewStore sends a confirmation to the customer when **all** the
    items in a

    fulfillment request have been processed for shipment. For example, a
    confirmation is sent to

    the customer only when all items in the fulfillment request have been
    dispatched for delivery,

    or when all items have been delivered.
Possible notifications are:


    - `shipment_dispatched`: Sent when a shipment left the fulfillment location
    and is on its way to the customer.

    - `shipment_delayed`: Sent when a shipment is delayed because the
    fulfillment takes longer than expected.

    - `shipment_cancelled`: Sent when a shipment is canceled.

    - `shipment_delivered`: Sent when a shipment is delivered to the customer.

    - `shipping_option.estimate_changed`: Sent when the estimated time of
    delivery has changed.

    - `package.status_updated`: Sent when the status of a delivery has changed.

    - `in_store.ready_for_pick_up`: Sent when an [in-store
    pickup](/docs/glossary.html#term-BOPIS) order is ready to be picked up.
