    This resource contains the provider rate of an order.

    A provider rate is how NewStore identifies a shipping provider and the rates
    they offer.

    For example, *FedEx Overnight*, *UPS Next Day*, *DHL On-demand delivery*.


    **Note:** If youâ€™re looking to [integrate a shipping
    provider](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shipment)

    for booking, updating, and canceling deliveries, see

    [Shipping Provider Webhooks](/api/webhooks/delivery_hook).


    A typical use case for the shipping options webhook is to define the
    supported shipping providers and rates for a

    specific list of products being purchased. If an ordered product is too
    heavy or too large, for example, these

    webhooks allow you to offer a customer

    [customized shipping
    prices](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shippingoptions/#custom-shipping-price)

    that can cater to this non-standard package.


    To develop an adapter, see [shipping
    options](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shippingoptions).

        Requests provider rates configuration, including service level, provider
        name, and shipping offer price.


        **Any provider rate response here OVERRIDES any other provider rate
        configuration made in NewStore.**

        This means you fully control which values are in use. If something is
        not available, consider it empty.

        For example, `return_provider_rate` is not supported through custom
        provider rates.


        **The order of the returned rates is important**: it will override any
        priority or existing order that you can

        have in your [fulfillment
        configuration](https://docs.newstore.net/developers/tutorials/fulfillment-config-new).


        **Important:** See [Retrieving custom shipping
        prices](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shippingoptions/#custom-shipping-price)

        to understand how to use the ``use_as_customer_facing_cost`` flag in the

        fulfillment configuration and the price `source` in your adapter.
