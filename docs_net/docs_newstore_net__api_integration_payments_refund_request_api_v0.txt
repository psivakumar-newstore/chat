Represents a refund request, triggered by a return or appeasement. Although a refund request
is bound to an order, it need not contain order items or shipping information. For example,
money that your business offers voluntarily to appease a customer when their previous order
was delivered late, is not tied to an item or to a shipping rate.
A refund request can be pending, successful, or failed. A successful refund request may depend
on the captured amount and on previous refunds (pending and successful).

Create refund request
Creates a refund request to initiate a refund. This call is asynchronous.
A successful response means that the refund request was accepted and will be executed after there are enough
captured funds.
To import a historical refund from other applications into NewStore set
is_historical
to
true
in the
request.
Note:
When the refund request is successful, an email is sent to the customer if you provided their email
address. No email is sent for historical refund requests.
Important:
When creating the refund request, ensure that you specify the value of the
amount
property correctly,
according to the specified currency. For example, if the currency is specified as
USD
and the product price (
amount
) has more than 2 decimal places, it is considered as
invalid by the platform.
For more information, see
pricing dependencies on currency
