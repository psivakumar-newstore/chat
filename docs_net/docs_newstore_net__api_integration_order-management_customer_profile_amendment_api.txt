Use this
resource
to manage customer profiles that are associated with orders
in the NewStore platform.
Using this API, you can create a request to update the customer profile information for specified
orders, and add details such as an updated name or external ID, email, or internal customer ID to the order.
The order details in the NewStore platform are updated in the background, with an
update rate limit of 20,000 orders/hour.
Once updated, the orders are listed for the associated customer profile in NOM or Associate App.
Important
:.
There is no validation check for the profile details in the platform, and no external events
are emitted. When using this API, ensure that the correct details are being updated
for the order and associated customer, and that you reconcile these changes in any external
systems that require these modifications.
Ensure that the customer profile exists in the platform before you add the details to an
associated order via this API.
Update customer profile for order
Updates the customer profile information for the specified order.
For information about the limitations of this method, refer to the
