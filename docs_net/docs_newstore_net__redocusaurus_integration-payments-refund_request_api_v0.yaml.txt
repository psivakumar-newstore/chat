  description: >
    Represents a refund request, triggered by a return or appeasement. Although
    a refund request

    is bound to an order, it need not contain order items or shipping
    information. For example,

    money that your business offers voluntarily to appease a customer when their
    previous order

    was delivered late, is not tied to an item or to a shipping rate.


    A refund request can be pending, successful, or failed. A successful refund
    request may depend

    on the captured amount and on previous refunds (pending and successful).

        Creates a refund request to initiate a refund. This call is
        asynchronous.

        A successful response means that the refund request was accepted and
        will be executed after there are enough

        captured funds.

        To import a historical refund from other applications into NewStore set
        `is_historical` to `true` in the

        request.


        **Note:** When the refund request is successful, an email is sent to the
        customer if you provided their email

        address. No email is sent for historical refund requests.


        **Important:** When creating the refund request, ensure that you specify
        the value of the ``amount`` property correctly,

        according to the specified currency. For example, if the currency is
        specified as ``USD``

        and the product price (``amount``) has more than 2 decimal places, it is
        considered as

        invalid by the platform.
