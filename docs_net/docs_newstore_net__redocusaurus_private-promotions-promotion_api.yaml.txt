  version: v0
  description: >
    Represents a discount rule defining a type of discount. For example,
    shipping is free when

    the order value reaches $70.


    A discount rule is not an applicable discount, but it is needed to create a
    coupon definition

    leading to a [coupon](/docs/glossary.html#term-coupon). Using the coupon
    applies the discount. For more information,

    see the coupons [guide](/docs/development/api/guides/coupons.html).

        **Important:** Ensure that you specify the value of the ``amount``
        property correctly,

        according to the specified currency. For example, if the currency is
        specified as ``USD``

        and the product price (``amount``) has more than 2 decimal places, it is
        considered as

        invalid by the platform.

        **Important:** Ensure that you specify the value of the ``amount``
        property correctly,

        according to the specified currency. For example, if the currency is
        specified as ``USD``

        and the product price (``amount``) has more than 2 decimal places, it is
        considered as

        invalid by the platform.
