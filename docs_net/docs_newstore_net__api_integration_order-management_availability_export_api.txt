Represents the available to promise (ATP) quantity for products.
ATP is calculated by subtracting the sum of all allocations, reservations, and safety
stock quantity, from the stock on hand. At NewStore, ATP is also the sum of the
current ATP and future ATP.
Use this resource to perform a global ATP export for all fulfillment locations, or export ATP for a channel
(a group of fulfillment locations). The exported ATP for a channel is the combined ATP of all fulfillment
locations in the channel.
Notes
:
Each ATP export includes the external identifiers for the referenced product ID.
If no value is provided for the
last_updated_at
property during the
export
,
the ATP is recalculated from the current ATP information and exported.
If the ATP for a product has not changed in any location after the
last_updated_at
value
specified during the export, no results are returned.
For an
ATP export for a channel
, if the
ATP for a product has changed in a location after the
last_updated_at
value specified
during the export, the updated ATP of the whole channel is exported, and not just the
updated ATP of the location. See the following example.
The
last_updated_at
value
is not a timestamp
. Instead, it is an increasing integer number which changes with every ATP update in the NewStore platform.
For example, if the ATP for a product is
3
in
Store A
and
4
in
Store B
, the combined ATP exported by
the resource is
7
. If ATP for
Store A
changes to
0
and the ATP for
Store B
stays the same, the exported
ATP is
4
, and not
0
.
This resource contains the following sub-resources:
bulk
: Represents an ATP export job for the channel.
groups
: Represents a group of fulfillment locations for which you can start an export ATP job.
For example, a group of fulfillment locations can represent a region or a channel in your business.
Start global ATP export
Starts an export of the ATP quantities in all fulfillment locations.
To retrieve the exported ATP, use the
Get ATP for channel
method.
Authorizations:
newStoreAccessToken
Request Body schema:
application/json
last_updated_at
integer or null
A full availability export is performed when this value is not provided. When this value is provided the export will not contain availabilities that were updated before the provided value. You can use the value of the 'last_updated_at' property of the response provided by the /availabilities/bulk GET method.
Responses
201
Success. The response contains the identifier of the created bulk export job.
To retrieve the exported ATP, use the
Get ATP for channel
method.

method.

Parameters
group_name_or_availability_export_id
required
string
The identifier for the fulfillment location group for which you want to start an
ATP export. See
Create a fulfillment location group
.
Request Body schema:

Responses
201
Success. The response contains the

for the created bulk export job.
To retrieve the exported ATP, specify the
availability_export_id
in your request to

Get ATP for channel
Returns the result of the ATP export job for the provided
availability_export_id
.
As part of the response payload, the
link
property contains a secure link that points to
a zip file containing the availability data.
The zip file contains a file named
availabilty.json
, which contains the availability data.
Important:
Copying or pasting the link may damage it. The link to the archive expires after a week.
For a
global ATP export
, see the
schema
for the payload of the
availabilty.json
file.
For an
ATP export for a channel
, the
schema
of the
availabilty.json
file is similar to that of a global ATP export, but also includes the
last_updated_at
and
group_revision
properties.
The zip file has a naming pattern of
availability_export-<export_id>
, where
<export_id>
refers
to the unique ID corresponding to the ATP export request that produced the zip file.
