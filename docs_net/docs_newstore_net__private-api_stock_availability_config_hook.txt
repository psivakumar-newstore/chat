Download OpenAPI specification

Download
Requests availability information from an external system.
A typical use case for this webhook is when NewStore is being used as Tier 2 OMS and doesn't maintain ATP.
Note:
When the request can't be processed, either by the server implementing this webhook or the external system,
the platform will assume none of the items are available.
Note:
As of now only product identifiers is a supported external identifier.
