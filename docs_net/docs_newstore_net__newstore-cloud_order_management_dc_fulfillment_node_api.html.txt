Cancel items
Marks some or all items of a fulfillment request as canceled. This immediately releases
allocations and means that the item can no longer be fulfilled.
To retrieve the status of the cancelation, use the
Get item cancelation status
.
Note:
This only applies to orders routed to a DC or warehouse for fulfillment.
To cancel an item in an order that is routed to a store for fulfillment, contact the
support team
.
Important:
You cannot cancel an item
after
it has been shipped or rejected.
Note:
In case the order contains multiple items wit the same product ID, the least expensive one will be picked first. 
If all items have the same price then a random item will be picked.
Example:
Order contains the following 4 items:
Product ID: product1, Price: USD 20
Product ID: product1, Price: USD 10
Product ID: product2, Price: USD 10
Product ID: product2, Price: USD 10
When calling the canceled items endpoint with only
product1
, then the item priced at USD 10 will be marked as canceled first.
When the canceled items endpoint is called again with
product1
, then the remaining item priced at USD 20 will be marked as canceled.

Reject items
Marks some or all items of a fulfillment request as not
fulfillable. Provide a rejection reason for each item.

able to fulfill the request.

  warehouse for fulfillment.
To cancel a fulfillment request that is routed to a store,
contact the

To address all products for a given fulfillment request,
supply an empty product-id; see payload example
Special case; with no specificity
-- this operation will defensively fail
with an
invalid_item
error if more than one object is
supplied.
Note:
In case the order contains multiple items wit the same product ID, the least expensive one will be picked first. 
If all items have the same price then a random item will be picked.
Example:
Order contains the following 4 items:
Product ID: product1, Price: USD 20
Product ID: product1, Price: USD 10
Product ID: product2, Price: USD 10
Product ID: product2, Price: USD 10
When calling the reject items endpoint with only
product1
, then the item priced at USD 10 will be marked as rejected first.
When the reject items endpoint is called again with
product1
, then the remaining item priced at USD 20 will be marked as rejected.

The request is invalid. The possible reasons are:

The shipment information for some products conflicts with the existing shipment information. For
example
item1
is marked as
shipped
with carrier 'Foo' in the request, but has already been
posted with carrier
Bar
in an earlier request. In case the order contains multiple items with the same product id and not all items are shipped yet, the request can be tried again.
The format of the shipment information is invalid.
The provided item ID does not belong to the fulfillment request.
