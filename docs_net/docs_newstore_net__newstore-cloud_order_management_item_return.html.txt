Create return (legacy)
Initiates the return process for item(s) in an order.
Imports a historical return into NewStore when
is_historical
is set to true.
You must specify the condition code for an item when creating a return.
NewStore creates condition codes for your business.
To retrieve the list of condition codes configured for your business, contact
the support team.
If the refund amount is not provided in the request, it is calculated by the platform:
If only some items from the order are returned, sum of the item prices is refunded.
If the config property
refund_shipping_cost
is set to
True
and all items in the
order are returned, the amount refunded includes the sum of the item prices and the
shipping costs.
If the config property
refund_shipping_cost
is not set, or set to
False
,
the sum of the item prices is refunded. Shipping costs are not included in this amount,
and not refunded.
