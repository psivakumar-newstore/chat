Use these APIs to manage notification options for your shipment related events.
Note
: NewStore sends a confirmation to the customer when
all
the items in a
fulfillment request have been processed for shipment. For example, a confirmation is sent to
the customer only when all items in the fulfillment request have been dispatched for delivery,
or when all items have been delivered.
Possible notifications are:
shipment_dispatched
: Sent when a shipment left the fulfillment location and is on its way to the customer.
shipment_delayed
: Sent when a shipment is delayed because the fulfillment takes longer than expected.
shipment_cancelled
: Sent when a shipment is canceled.
shipment_delivered
: Sent when a shipment is delivered to the customer.
shipping_option.estimate_changed
: Sent when the estimated time of delivery has changed.
package.status_updated
: Sent when the status of a delivery has changed.
in_store.ready_for_pick_up
: Sent when an
in-store pickup
order is ready to be picked up.
