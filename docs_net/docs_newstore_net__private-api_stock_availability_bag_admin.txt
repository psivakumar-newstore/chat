Authorizations:
newStoreAccessToken
Request Body schema:
application/json
bag
required
Array of
objects
non-empty
The list of (product_id/quantity) used to find the fulfillment nodes.
location_filter
object
(
location
)
Represents parameters to search stores by location. Limits the results to only fulfillment nodes that are within a certain radius from the provided geo location.
If a geo location is set, the results would be sorted by their distance from that location.
Set the radius to zero if you just want to sort by distance, but do not want any filtering to be applied.
IMPORTANT: If this was used, fulfillment nodes that are not associated with a geo tagged store will not be filtered out.
only_in_store_pickup
boolean
Default:
false
Set to true to get only stores with in_store_pickup set.
only_stores
boolean
Default:
false
Set to true to get only fulfillment nodes that are associated with a store.
ignore_atps
boolean
Default:
false
Set to true to get all the fulfillment nodes, regardless of whether they have atps for all the products provided in the bag or not.
Fulfillment nodes that do not have enough products to cover the bag will have a field has_atps set to false.
limit
number
Default:
100
Use to limit the number of results returned by GetBagAvailability end point.
IMPORTANT: If this is not provided a default of 100 will be used to limit the results.
