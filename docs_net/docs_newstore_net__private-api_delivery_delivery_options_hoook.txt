Represents the checkout step during which shipping options are required.
This resource contains the
provider rate
of an order.
A provider rate is how NewStore identifies a shipping provider and the rates they offer.
For example,
FedEx Overnight
,
UPS Next Day
,
DHL On-demand delivery
.
Note:
If youâ€™re looking to
integrate a shipping provider
for booking, updating, and canceling deliveries, see
Shipping Provider Webhooks
.
A typical use case for the shipping options webhook is to define the supported shipping providers and rates for a
specific list of products being purchased. If an ordered product is too heavy or too large, for example, these
webhooks allow you to offer a customer
customized shipping prices
that can cater to this non-standard package.
To develop an adapter, see
shipping options
.
